great Friendfliip with Bajil * ; at lajft, they having both dedicated themfelves to facred Studies, the Clergy of A?ttioch had refolved to
lay hold on them, and to ufe that holy Violence, which was, in thofe Times, often done to the beft

Who *

He this Bajil was, is uncertain :

IS fuppofed by Socrates to have been the

great St. Bafil of Ccefarea 3 by Photius and

others, the Bqfil that was Bifhop of Se-

leucia: But, perhaps, it was neither the

one nor the other; the lirft being almoft

impoffible, the other highly improbable :

told Chryfojlom^ he concealed his

believing that his Friend was of the fame Mind, did not go out of
the Way, and fo was laid hold on : But Chryfqflom had hid him-
felf Bajily feeing he could not be found, did all that was pofTible to excufe himfelf : But that not being accepted of, he was or-
dained. Next time that he met
his Friend, he expoftulated fe-verely with him, for having for-

ABSTRACT t LIFE O F T H E OF
St. CHRTSOSTOM.

ST. Chryfojlofn was Bifhop of Conjiafttinople in the Reign of

the Emperors Arcadius and Hono-
rius. He obtained the Name of

X^ucrorojvcoc (Golden'tongued)y on ac-
count of his Eloquence. He was a

Native of Antioch^ defcended from

noble Parents, Secundus and An-
thufa. He was taught Rhetoric by

Libanius^ Philofophy by Andraga-
thins. He applied himfelf to the

Study of Divinity under Diodorus

a3

and

vi 'Li'f^ of St. Chrysostom* and Bajilius. He was firft a Reader
in the Church o^Antioch ; was afterwards ordained a Prieft ; and, on the Death of NeSiarius^ was promoted
to the See of Conjlantinople^ in the
Year of our Lord 401. He was naturally of an impetuous Tem-
per, and free of Speech ; which
expofed him to many Inconveni-
encies. Having declaimed, with
great Vehemence, againft the Em-
prefs Etidociay he was banilhed by
Command of the Emperor ; but the
People riiing up in Arms, obliged the Emperor to recall him foon after.
He was a fecond time expelled, and
banifhed into Arine7tia^ where he died, in the Year of our Lord 411.

BOOK TH^ first;

CHAPTER L

MONG the many Friends

I formerly had, who were true and {incere ; who

both well underftood the

Laws of Friendfliip, and exactly ob-

ferved them ; there was one parti-
cularly who bore me fo lingular an

Efteem and Afiedlion, that he ex-

my celled the reft: of

Friends in the

Degree of his Love tov/ards me, as

B

much

2

St. Chrysostom

much as they did my common and

ordinary Acquaintance.

This Friend was perpetually with
me; for, as we were brought up in

the fame Studies, and under the

fame Mafters, fo our Inclinations, our

Applications and Defires, were the-,
fame. Nor did this Agreeablenefs

of Difpofition in us continue only
while we were Fellow-Students, but afterwards, when we came out into

the World, and were to chufe what
Courfe of Life we would follow,

even then there ftill appeared the
fame Similitude of Difpofition, the
fame Harmony and Union as be-

fore.
Nor did it a little contribute to
render this Union of our Wills firm and conftant, that there was no great

Difference between us in point of

worldly circumiiances, and that

neither

of' the Priest hood/

%

neitHer of us had any Reafon to

overlook the other on the Account

y

of a large Eftate. For, as for my

own Part, my Riches were far from

beinp- a Burden to me ; and as for

him^ his Affairs were at a very low

Ebb : Nevertheiefs, in this alfo we

were alike, that our Minds were

fuited to the Mediocrity of our

Fortunes. Befides, our Birth was

equally good ; fo that all things

concurred to unite our Affedions.

^

But as foon as we attained the

Age, when it was expeded that we

fhould enter upon that happy State,

a monaftic JJfe, and apply ourfelves

to the Study of true Philofophy, the

Balance of our Inclinations hung no
my longer in an equal Poife, but

Friend's Scale, being free from all

Incumbrances, mounted upwards,

whereas mine, being oppreffed with

B2

worldly

worldly Defircs and youthful Ima-

ginations, funk downwards with the

Weight.

Our Friend fliip, however, con-

tinued firm as before, only we did

not converfe fb frequently : For,

indeed, it was not proper for thofe

Perfons to ccrrefpond familiarly to-

gether, who were attached to Stu-

dies of fo different a Nature. But,,
whea once I began to exalt my

Head, a little above the Waves of

this World, and thought of difen-

gaging myfelf from lecular Con-
cerns, he received me with open

Arms : But neither fo could we

maintain our former Equality; for

he had gained much Advantage over

me, on two Accounts, having given

himfelf up to the Studies of heavenly
Wifdom much fooner than myfelf,

and that too with a much more

eager

^ /;5^ Priesthood.

5

eager Application, and exalted De-

fire.

But, though be had thus the Start

of me, yet fuch was his Goodnefs,
and fo true a Value had he for my

Friendfhip, : that, withdrawing him-

felf from the Converfation of his

other Friends, he gave up his Time

me wholly to

: Still profecuting his

former Defign of perfuading me to

retire from the World, which, as I

faid before, he had not been able,

as yet, to effeft, through the In-
my dolence and Indifpofition of

Temper. Nor, indeed, was it pof-

fible for me, who was fo conftantly

engaged at the Bar, at the Theatre,

and other public Diverfions, to have

much of his Converfation, who lived

always at home, and was wholly

engroffed by his Books. Having

been thus hindered hitherto, he had

B3

no

;

6

St. Chrysostom

no fooner an Opportunity to renew

my his SollicitatioRs of

entering into

the fame Method of Life with him-

felf, than he gave Birth to that De-

-.vfire which had been fo long con-

ceived in his Mind. For he never

left me, no, not a Minute in a Day,
but kept conftantly plying me with

moft prefTing Arguments, that, for-

fakino; our Houfes, we fhould retire

together to fome fequeftered Place.

In fhort, he prevailed upon me:
And nothing now remained, but

to execute our Defign. The only

thing which was likely to hinder
me from gratifying my Friend, or

rather myfelf, in this Affair, was the
repeated Inftances of my Mother who no fooner perceived my Inten-
tion, than, taking me by the Hand, fhe led me into her Chamber: And,

fitting down by the Side of that Bed
where

World, fhe burft into Tears, and,
with Words which moved my Com-

paffion even more than her Tears,
{he complained to me in this Man-

CHAP. III.

'T^HIS, and much more, did 1 my Mother remonftrate to
me : Which when I related to my
generous Friend, he was fo far from
being moved therewith, that he re-
renewed his former Sollicitations, and
made more preffing Inftances than

before.

While Matters were thus circum-

flanced, he continually intreating
me and I as conftantly refufing, on

a fudden there was a Report fpread,

which gave us no fmall Unealinefs
namely, that we were both of us
defigned, ere long, to be promoted

to the Dignity of the Epifcopal

Order.

When

oj the Priesthood. iq When I firft heard this, I was
ftruck with Fear and Surprize : With Fear, left I fliould be dragged
to the Eledion againft my Will;
and with Surprize, that the Fathers
fhould think of us for this facred
Office: Efpecially, when I conii-
dered myfelf, and could not find
that I had any thing in me worthy
of this Honour.
On the fpreading of this Rumour, my Friend diredly came lo
me ; and, taking me afide as one
unacquainted with the Matter, told
me all that he had heard ; and
begged of me, that we might not
foUov/ different Counfels, but that
our Refolutions and Proceedings might appear to be uniform in this Affair, as they had hitherto been in
others : That, for his own Part, he
was ready to follow my Example,
which

i6 St. CHRYsostaM
which way foever I fhould think
bell to difpofe of myfelf, whether to fly from the Eledion, or to fub-
tnit to it.
Perceiving, therefore, his Readi-
nefs, and thinking that I fhould be very injurious to the Church, if, for
the fake of my own InabiUty, I
fhould defraud the Flock of Chrifl
of fo excellent a Perfon, who was,
in all Refpeds, fo fit to prefide over it; I thought it not proper to de-
clare my Mind in this Matter, but
fuffered myfelf to do what I had never done before, viz. to conceal
my own Sentiments from my Friend :
Telling him, therefore, that I would
confider of this fome other Time
(for that the thing would not be urged upon us inflantly) ; and that, whenever it was, he need not doubt
but we fhould be unanimous, and
take

17

take the fame Steps, I perfuaded him, for the prefent, to think no
more of the Matter. Not long after, when the Time
v/as at hand that we flioiild be or-
dained, I hid myfeif. He knowing
nothing of it, was taken, and led to the Bi (hop's, as upon fome other Account, where he received the
Yoke of Chrift: Not doubting, from

Vvhat I had promifed, but that I would certainly follow his Example

or rather thinking, that in this he followed mine. For fome that were pre-
fent feeing him angry, and ill-pleafed

at his being thus furprized, deceived
him, by faying, how abfurd a thing it was, that I, who in all Mens

Eyes feemed the moft untraftable of

the two, fliould fo quietly reiign

myfeif to the Judgmxnt of the Bi-

fhop ; but that he, who was always

C

known

i8 St. Chrysostom
known to excell in Prudence and
Good-nature, fhould, upon this Oc-
calion, behave himlelf in a fierce and haughty Manner, flying back, con-tradiding, and refufing to comply. This had its Effed, and he fub-
mitted.
But when he underftood that I
had fled, and concealed myfelt, he
refted not till he had found me
out ; and, fitting down by me, with Shame and Sorrow in his Looks, he
feemed paflionately eager to have Ipoken ; but the inward Opprefllon and Anxiety which he laboured un-
der fliopped his Speech. The Vehe-
mence of his Concern choaked his Words to fuch a Degree, that, when he opened his Lips, he had no Power
to utter himfelf, through the violent Perplexity and Perturbation of his
Mind. Seeing him thus full of Tears and

^/y^^ Priesthood, iq
and Trouble, and well knowing from what Caufe all this Concern proceeded, I could not contain that Excefs of Pleafure which I felt within
myfelf, but burfl: out into a loud
Laughter ; and, catching him fajft by his right Hand, I conflrained him to
kifs me ; at the iame Time glorifying God, that he had crowned my Con-
trivance with all that Succefs which
I had fo much delired it might have. But when he faw me thus joyful and
pleafant, and perceived thereby that
I had plainly deceived him in this
Matter, he changed Colour, and was
very angry.

C H A P. IV.

OVv^EVER, recovering him-

felf a little from thofe Dif-

orders ; Although (faith he) you have

C2

no

20

S T. C H R Y S O S T O M

no Regard for me, nor any Value,

my for

Credit, (for what Reafon, I

cannot imagine), yet, m.ethinks, you

fliould take more Care of your ov/n

Reputation. For, to be plain with

you, your late Behaviour hath
opened all Mens Mouths againft
you, who fcruple not to fay, that

you fled from this facred OjEce only

out of a proud and vain-glorious
Humour : Nor have I met with one Man that fo much as attempts to
clear you of this Charge. For my
own Part, I cannot walk the Streets,
but I am prefently attacked on all
Sides, and blamed on your Ac-
count every Day. My own Friends,
where-ever they meet me^ accufe
me v/ith being acceffory to your
Mifrntinagement, and a great Part of your Condemnation falls on me. For, - fay they, you could not be
ignorant

;

of the Priesthood. 21

ignorant of his Intentions, it being

notorious that he always opened his
Heart to you : And, therefore, you

ought not thus to have diffembled

the Matter with us, but to have ac-

quainted us with his Defigns, which,

ifyou had done, we fhould, no doubt,

have circumvented hirn, by fome

Stratagem or other. Now, w^hat
Reply could I make to this ? To

confefs that I w^as a Stranger to your

Defigns, was to reprefent our Friend-

fhip as a mere Piece of Hypocrify

which I was afhamed to do. For

although fo it i«, as now too plainly

appears from your late Behaviour,

and

as

you

yourfelf

cannot

deny ;

yet I thought, that whatever Faults

there might be between us, it w^ould

be much more for our Credit to hide

therp, than to expofc them to the

World, efpecially to thofe \\tiO are

C3

but

52 St.Chrysostom
but indifFerendy affeded towards us.
Unwilling, therefore, to own the Truth, and to let them know how
Matters fland between us, I am forced to hold my Tongue, to call down my Eyes with Confufion, and
to fhun, when I am able, the meet-
ing with my Acquaintance. Nay,
fhould I, by owning the Truth, endeavour to excufe myjfelf from the Crime of being acceflbry to your Mifmanagement yet this would be
;
a vain Attempt, it would be what they would look upon as mere Fiction, and nothing elfe. For it is
impoffible ever to make them be-
lieve, that Bafil was one of thofe
from whom you concealed any of
your Intentions : Thoiigh, as to the thing itfelf, {ince I perceive it is a Pleafure to you that fo it fhould
be, 1 am content, and fhall not dif-

pute the Matter with you. But this
is not all : There are large Portions
of Shame yet behind, which we muft

be loaded with. Some accufe you

of Infolence, others, of Vain-glory

But they who are moft fevere in

their Cenfures, lay them both to

our Charge, and augment the whole

by that great Indignity and Affront

which (fay they) we have offered to

thofe who have vouchfafed thus to

honour us ; adding, moreover, that

the Difgrace they have fuffered from

us, had it been much greater, was

but what they juftly deferved, who

could pafs by fo many Perfons of

fuch Excellence and Worth, and

chufe a couple of raw Youths, who

were but of Yefterday, and who had

not yet difengaged themfelves from

worldly Cares (however, for the pre-

fent, they contracted the Brow, put

C4

on

24 St. Ch R YSOSTOM
on Black, and diffennbled a Gravity of Perfon and Behaviour), and promote them, at once, to fuch an eminent Dignity, as they themfelves could never have had the Vanity to
afpire to ; no, not fo much as in a
Dream : And thus, fay they, Men
of Years and Gravity, who, from their Youth up, have exercifed them-, felves in all the Study and Hardfliips
of Religion, are ftill in the Place of
Inferiors ; while they, who have the
Rule over them, are mere Boys, that have no Regard to thofe Laws by .which their AdiTiinifcration is to be
reflated.
This, and a great deal more, i?,

be diffembled, that whereas I, with

all the Opennefs imaginable, did, in
a manner, put my very Soul into

your Hands ; you, on the contrary,

Subtlety and underhand Dealing that

which I followed to be good and ufeful, you yourfelf, one would think, fhould not have fhunned the
Advantage of it ; and, if you knew
it to be hurtful and pernicious, furely you ought not to have fuffered that
Friend, who was fuperior to all
others in your Affedion, to have fallen into it. Yet this you did,
and in this you was the chief Inftrument : Though, to fay the Truth, there was little Occafion to ufe fo
much Artifice and Craft towards one who always fpoke and aded
iincerely, and without Difguife. However, as I faid before, I do
not now call you to an Account for
thefe things; neither do I reproach

.you with that folitary State into
which you have thrown me, by
putting an End to thofe friendly

Meetings and Converfations, from which I ufed to receive fuch

Pleafure and Advantage. All thefe

things I pafs over lightly, and with

Silence ; not becaufe your Offence

is flight in itfelf, but be-

caufe this was the Rule which I

.fixed to myfelf, from the very firft

Moment that I courted your Friendfhip, that, however at any Time you fhould grieve me by any Unkind-

nefs, I would never bring you under

a Neceffity of apologizing for your-

felf ; though, moft certainly, the In-
jury you have done me is by no

means a trifling one, as you your-

felf knov7 ; efpecially, if you call to
mind how I am, at once, deprived of all that Felicity which we both

promifed

ourfelves, that our mutual Love would be a mutual Advantage and

Safety to us; and others faid, that

it would be no lefs ufeful to the
World. Now, though I had no

Thoughts that our Union would be
of much Ufe to others, yet I flat-

tered myfelf, that it would be of fin-

gular Advantage to ourfelves, fince

confiderable is the Advantage of a well-timed Deceit, done with a right Purpofe, and a good Defign, that
many have been Sufferers for ne-

Nay, if you look back on the fa-
mous Generals that have jflouriftied, from the Beginning of the World

that you will find the greater Part of
their fuccefsful Aftions to have been
chiefly owing to Stratagem and Deceit ; and the wife Contrivers of them have met with more Applaufe than thofe who, by mere Dint of Arms,
have vanquifhed their Enemies in the open Field : For thefe obtain
their Vidories at fuch a prodigious Expence,

that they are, on the whole, but of finall Advantage to them ; and the

Victors are in Httle better Condition

Treafure no lefs exhaufted. Neither,

indeed, have they the fole Glory of

of it redounds to them, whofe Cou-

rage was not conquered, though

their Bodies were, and who, if they

could have fought without falling in

the Field, would ftill have continued

to have given Proofs of an undaunted

Valour : Whereas he that gains a

Victory by Stratagem and Condudt,

expofes his Enemy, at once, to De-

ftruction and Derifion. For though,

Strength, the Vanquifhed have their

yet it is quite otherwife where a Victory is obtained by Policy alone For, in that Cafe, the Glory of the
Adion refts entirely on his Side who
conquers : belides that he carries
home with him a mofl: perfeft and
unmixed Pleafdre for a Victory ob-
tained without Lofs of Blood. For, in warlike Attempts, it is
not with the Wifdom of the Mind^ as it is with Riches or Numbers of
Men : Thefe, the more they are
made ufe of, the more they are di-^
miniflied : Whereas, on the contrary, this, the of tener you have Re-
courfe to it, the miOre it brightens,
and increafes on your Hands.
Nor is this Sort of Deceit ufeful
only in War, and in pubHc AfTairs
but in Peace alfo, and in one's own
private Concerns, it is often of great Advantage, and that too amongfc

beft of Men! and, for this
Reafon, I prevented you, by faying before, that it was lawful to ufe
Deceit, not only in War, and againft an Enemy, but in Peace alfo, and
towards one's Friends.
Nay, this very thing is, in fome
Cafes, ufeful not only to the Deceiver, but to the Deceived. If you
doubt the Tryth of this, go but to
a Phyfician, and afk him in what
Man--,

Manner he fometimes cures his Pa^ tients; and he will tell you, that his Art is not always of itfelf fuf-
ficient, but he is often obliged to
mix Deceit with his Medicines. For when the Cafe is fuch, that, either
by the Untradablenefs of the Patient, or the Obftinacy of his Dif-
temper, the Prefcriptions of the
Phyfician can have no EfFedl, there he muft, of Neceflity, have Recourfe to Artifice and Contrivance, and ad: his Part, as Players do on the Stage,
under a Difguife : And here, if
you pleafe, I will give you a merry
Inftance of one of thofe many Arti-
fices which I have heard pradifed by thofe Sons of Art.
It happened that a certain Man

that were proper to abate his Diftemper, but had a longing Delire for a good Draught of Wine, and begged earneftly of every one that
came into the Room, to gratify this
his pernicious Appetite ; which, had
k been done, would have inflamed
his Fever to fuch a Degree, as would
have made the poor Fellow quite
diflraded. Here, therefore, where
there was no Room for Skill to exert
itfelf, they were forced to have Re-
courfe to Fraud and Contrivance, by the Help of which, the Phyfician effeded what he could not compafs by his Art : For, getting an earthen
Pan, jufl: come hot out of the Furnace, he dipped it all over in Wine
and ordering the Room to be dark-
ened, that the lick Man might not
difcover the Deceit, he poured out the Wine, filled it v^dth Water, and
gave

gave it to his Patient to drink.
The fick Man, deceived by the ftrong Smell of the Wine into which
the Pan had been dipped, flayed not
curioufly to examine v^hat it was
which the Dodor gave him, but,
being periuaded by his Noftrils, that it really was what he imagined, and
being hindered, by the Want of
Light, from diicovering the Cheat, and being alfo eagerly defirous to quench his Thirfk, he drank it ofF
with the utm.oft Greedinefs. Upon
v/hich his exceflive Thirft was allayed, his Fever abated, and the
Man recovered. So great are the
Power and Advantage of Deceit, v/hich as you have already itzw in
this one Example, fo it were endlefs to produce Inftances of the like

Deceit, but Management rather, and Wifdom, and good Contri-
\^ance, by which Men work them-

' Add to this, that the Difeafes of

Beafts are manifeft, whether it be the Rot, the Murrain, an accidental Hurt, or any thing elfe which pains and diforders the Creature ; and the Appearance of the
Diftemper renders it fo much the
more eafy to cure. There is another thing alfo which

greatly contributes to their fpeedy
Recovery ; and that is, that the Shepherd hath full Power over his
Sheep, to make them fubmit to
thofe Remedies which are proper
for them. If the Searing- iron or the

Incifion-knife is to be applied, he
can bind them faft for the Opera-

tion, If it be neceffary to change
their Food, or to hinder them from Drink, he can £hut them up, and keep them confined as long as he pleafes. In a Word, he can, very

eafily

c/" //5^ Priesthood.

6i

eafily, make them fubmit to all
Applications which he fhall juc^ge conducive to the Health and Sound-

nefs of his Flock.

But, with the fpiritual Difeafes of

the Soul, it is quite otherwife. For,

in the firft Place, it is^ hard to dif-

cover them : For the things cf a

And how fhall' any prefcribe to a

fickSoul, the Nature of whofe Dif-

temper he is not acquainted with ?

Nay, fo far from that, that he is

often ignorant whether it be lick,

or no.
But how difficult foever it be to

find out the Difeafes of the Soul,

yet it is harder to cure them, when

they are found out. For the Cafe

here is widely different from that of

the

the Shepherd and his Sheep : For there he hath the Liberty to bind the difeafed Creature, to keep it from Food, to burn, or cut, as fhall feem moft proper to him. But here?
the receiving of fuitable Medicines
is not in the Power of him that adminifters them, but of him that
needs them, as we may learn from

I can hardly think you ferious in

now pretend to offer for my Con-

folation, are fo far from anfwering

that End, that, on the contrary,
they convince me what jufl: Caufe I

have to mourn and lament rny Con-

dition, with much Perplexity and

Trouble of Mind: In the firil Place,

becaufe I find that I have been de-

ceived and betrayed by you ; But

abundantly more in the fecond

Place ; becaufe, from thofe very

Reafons which you have now of-

fered for your ow^n Vindication in

this Matter, I come to have a full

Knowledge and Apprehenfion of that

Depth of Misfortunes into which I

am plunged. For, if the true Rea-

fon of your withdrawing yourfelf

from

caufe you knew yourfelf incapable
and infufficient to bear the Weight
of fo facred a Funftion, how much

though I had ever fo earneftly delired it ; efpecially when, in this
Affair, I committed myfelf entirely
to your Diredion ; in which, it is
true, you confolted your own Wel-
fare, but negleSed mine : And, had you only neglected it, it had been
happy for me ; but, as if that were
nothing, you, by your Artifices, was
the chief Inftrument of betraying
me into the Power of thofe who
lay in wait for me.
And think not to efcape, by fay-

by common Report, which gave you
an Opinion of fomcthing excellent

indeed, common Report may often
be miftaken, and ill-grounded ; but
there is no Room to apprehend any
Danger from thence, if, befides this, there is diligent Enquiry and due
Examination made : And for this
Caufe he m.entions the Teftimonial

fpefted, that I darkened and dif-

guifed the Matter, by fetching it

that you are arrived to the utmoft

That we ought not to fcruple the affronting of Men, when we cannot
honour them, without being obliged to affront God. Nor, indeed, is it
fafe for the Perfons that are thus offended, but of very dangerous Confequence, to fuffer themfelves tq
be angry on fiich an Account. For
I think it becom.es thofe that are
dedicated to God, and who have
their Eyes fixed on him alone, to
he fo piouily difpofed, as not to

fhould (in this Manner) be diflio-
noured a thoufimd Times. And

from hence, alfo, it is plain, that I
had not fo much as a Thought of

affronting thofe excellent Perfons.

And, truly, if an infoient Hu-

mour of Pride or Vain-glory had

been the Motive by which I had

been influenced (according to thofe

Objections which, you fay, are fre-
quently made againfl me), I might

juftly be looked upon as moft bafe
and injurious, in dcfpifing Men of

fuch admirable Virtue and high Sta-

tion, who, befides, had fo well de-

my fer v^ed at

Hands. For, if to

injure thofe that have done us no

Wrong, is worthy of Punifhment
how highly ought we to honour and

efteem thofe, who, merely out of

lence, chufe to advance us to Ho,

them, in a greater or lefs Degree,
no one hath any Ground to affirm.
And how great Punifhment doth he
deferve, that returns Evil for Good ?
But if nothing of this ever entered
into my Mind; but if I declined
that heavy Burden, the Priefthood,
on a quite different Confideration, though they do not, perhaps, approve of what I have done, yet, at leaft, they might pardon it, and not

as, that they had Regard only to

had infinuated myfelf into their

That as an old Man is not to be
admitted to the minifterial Office
merely on account of his grey Hairs^
lb neither is a young Man to be re-

of them; except he be, indeed, a Novice, one lately planted and inftruded in the Chriftian Faith. And, truly, there is a wide Difference be-^ tween thefe two.

BOOK THE THIRD

CHAPTER L

S for the Slight which I am

faid to have put upon thole
who woiild have honoured

ine with the facred Office ; as if
i had had a Defigii to affront them

by withdrawing myfelf from it ; I

have fpokeii to thefe things, and
told you what I have to fay for my-

felf It remains that I fliow you,
in the next Place, that I did not do this, as fome otDJed, out of a proud
Spirit. And this I am now to make

clear to you.

Suppofe, then, that the Command

of an Army, or the Government of a

H

King-

g8 St. Chrysostom
Kingdom, had been offered me t Had I aded in that Manner, as I
have done in this (/. e. had I refufed and fled from it), would any one
have fufpeded or accufed me of
Pride in fo doing ? Nay, would
they not rather have thought me a Fool, or mad? And when the holy
Priefthood is offered me, which is
as much higher than a Kingdom,
as the Spirit is more excellent than
the Flefh, will any one fay, that I overlooked it through Difdain and
Contempt ? I think I need not infift on the Abfurdity of this, nor
fhow how inconflftent with good Senfe it is, that they, who refufe Pre-
ferments of a lefs Degree, Ihould
be cenfured as Madmen, while they^ who do the fame thing in Honours of a much more excellent Nature,
(hould, neverthelefs, be taxed, not

with Madnefs, but with Infolence and Pride* This is as if you Ihould
fay, that he who refufes to be an
Herdfrnan, doth not do it becaufe
he thinks himfelf above that Com-
mand, but becaufe he is plainly
diftradedj and cut of his Wits
Whereas he that refufes to be Mo-

narch of the whole World, or Cap-

tain-General of all the Armies in it, doth it, not becaufe he is out of his
Senfes^ but becaufe he is puffed up
with Pride*

But thefe things are by no means

conliftertt. Nor, indeed, do the

Cenfures of thofe who thus judge

fall harder on me^ than on them^

felves : For, truly^ the very Suppo-

Men fition, that it is poffible for

to

defpife the Dignity of the Priefc-

hood, is an Argument againft thofe

very Perfons who make ufe of it,

H2

that

100 St. CHRYsostdM

that they have a low Notion of that

facred Office : For, did they not

look upon it as a mean thing, and

of little Efteem or Confideration,

they would not have been fo forward

to fufped, that I had fhunned it

through Pride and Contempt.
And why hath no one ever yet

had Impudence enough to fufped

the fame thing concerning the Dig-

nity of Angels ; and affert, that

Fleflb. and Blood might obtain the

Honour of the angelical Nature,

were it not for' their Pride and Con-

tempt of it ? The Reafon is, becaufe we have high Thoughts and

Apprehenfions of thofe heavenly

Orders, infomuch, that we are per-

Man ^fuaded it is not poiTible for

to

·conceive a higher created Dignity
than that. So that, upon the Whole,
they who .reproach me with Pride,

and

af the Priesthood. ioi
and a Contempt of the facred Func-
tion, do much more juftly deferve
that Accufation : For, moft certainly, they had never fufpeded any fuch thing of others, had they not
firft of all had mean and defoicable
Notions of it themfelves.

CHAP. II.

NEITHER are they lefs in-

confiftent in their Objedions,

who accufe me, in this Matter, of

Ambition and Vain-glory. Nor, in-

deed, do I fee how they could have

brought a more efFedlual Argument
to clear me of this Accufation, than

this, by which they would pretend

to fix it on me : For, had I been

influenced by fuch a Spirit, furely

I fhould rather have accepted of the

Priefthood, than have fhunned and

be preferred before others, who had
fpent their whole Lives in Studies of a fpiritual Nature ? For me, I fay,
to have carried the Election againft
fuch Perfons, and to have had a fu-
perior Number of Votes on my Side,
this, as it would have raifed in all
Men an Opinion of fome great and
adrnirable Qualities in me, fo it
would have rendered me venerable
and confpicuous in their Eyes Whereas now, there are hardly any of the Church, except a few parti-

fo much as by Name. Nor are there many who know that I refufed that
Dignity, nor have all of them a per-

Earth, is, neverthelefs, to be placed
in the Rank of heavenly Fundions,
and that with the greateft Reafon Becaufe no mortal Man, no Angela or Archangel, or any other created Power, but the Holy Ghoft himfelf,

and hath given Men Reafon to be-

Thefe things are, indeed, grand and

But now turn away your Eyes,
and £x them on the Confecration of
our facred Myfteries, where you will
not only fee things wonderful, but things that furpafs all Admiration
For here the Prieft brings not Fire from Heaven, but the Holy Spirit and he offers a long Supplication^
iiot that a Torch let down from above may confume the Gifts, lying in open View ; but that Grace, defcending on the Sacrifice, may
thereby inflame the Souls of all that

than Silver purified in the Fire. And
is it pofiibie that any one, except, indeed, he be out of his Senfes, fhould delpife this moft tremendous Myftery ? Or, are you ignorant that

Mortal, cloathed with Flefh and

how great Honour the Grace of the

Holy Spirit hath dignified the Prieft-

thefe things are performed^ and other

a Power of binding Men ; but that

by all with the higheft Efteem ?
And fhall he^ who hath received from God a Power as much beyond

this as Fleaven is higher than the
Earth, and the Soul more excellerif than the Body ; fhall fuch a one, I
fay, be thought to have received fo fmall and vvorthlefs a Gift, Ss to be able himfelf to overlook and defpife it ? Far be from us the Madnefs of

all Sorts of Men, who readily take
upon them that holy FunSion, never
confidering their own Abilities, or
having any Regard to the Weight and Dignity of what they under-
take : And fo, v/hen they proceed
to the Execution of it, being loft
and bewildered in the Darknefs of
their own Ignorance, they become
the Caufe of infinite Misfortunes to the People that are committed to
their Care. And, I afllire you, this
very thing had like to have been
my own Cafe, if God, in great Mercy to his Church, and to my Soul, had not Ipeedily refcued me
from fo imminent a Danger.
And here I would afk, From

frequently fee in the Church ? I will te bold to fay, that they flow from no other Fountain than this, viz. that there is no due Care taken in

ehufing proper Perfons to be Bifhops

and Governors of the Flock; but

People are put into that high Charge
lightly, and inconfiderately. The
Head, mofl: certainly, ought to be
found and good ; how elfe fhall it
be able to difperfe thofe noxious Va-

pours, which afcend thither from other Parts of the Body ? If it cannot do this, if that principal Part be weak and infirm, and not of Strength fufficient to repell thofe unwholefome Fumes, the Confequence
muft be, that the Head itfelf will every Day grow weaker and worfe,

and, together with itfelf, deftroy

alfo the reft of the Body. And that

my For, indeed,

Friend, there

are many other Excellences, befides

thofe which have been already men-

tioned, which a Biihop ought to be

endued with, and which I myfeif
am deftitute of ; this efpecially, that
he ought to have no Defire for that

high Station. For v/hoever afpires

to this Dignity with Paffion and

Vehemence, will not ttop there,
when he hath attained it, but his
Ambition will increafe wdth his Pre-

ferment; and, being thus ftrongly

carried away with the Violence

thereof, he will fcruple nothing,

though never fo vile and bafe, no,

nor large pecuniary Expences, to

have fome Men contended for the

epifcopal Chair, that they have filled

the very Churches with Blood and

Slaughter, and the Cities with Ruin

arid Defolation. But this I fhall not
now infift on, left what I fay fhould

feem to fome Perfons incredible, and

beyond Belief.
In the mean Time, I am perfuaded, that Men ought to have fo

profound a Reverence and Regard

for the Weight of this high Funftion,

as to refufe it at firft, and drav/ back

from it ; and if it happens that

they are eledied to it afterwards,

and, after their Eledion, arc fo un-

Accord, diveft themfelves of that
Dignity. For thus may fuch an
DfFender reafonably hope to obtain
Mercy at the Hand of God :
Whereas he that retains it beyond what is meet, not only renders himfelf unworthy of Pardon, but alfo
farther irritates the divine Difplea-
fure, by adding to his firft Offence
a fecond of a more heinous Nature. But fuch Conftancy of Mind is
very rarely, if ever, to be met with and, in Truth, to affed: and af]3ire ambitiouily to this Honour, is a very peftilent and pernicious Difeafe : Nor doth this Affertion clafli
at all with the Doelrine of St. Patd^

Defire of this that I affirm to be fo dangerous.
CHAP. XL
THIS Defire, I fay, ought
carefully to be rooted out of
the Soul ; nor fhould a Man fuffer
it to faften upon him at firft ; that
fo he may be perfectly at Liberty to
perform all the Duties of his Place
with Freedom and Boldnefs. For
he that is not ambitious of being exalted to that Height of Power,
will no more be afraid of beino; depofed from it ; and he that is free from the Fear of that, will execute
all the Parts of his Office with fuch a Liberty as becomes a Chriflian :
Whereas they that live under the Fear and Dread of being turned out
of

C 1 3 8 S T. H R Y S O S T O Ml

of their Dignity, do really undergo a . moft difagreeable Servitude, at-
tended with many Evils, and often
find themfelves under an unhappy
NecefFity of offending both God and
Man.
The Soul, therefore, ought by
no means to be thus affefted : But
as we fee valiant Soldiers fight cou-
ragioully, and fall bravely in the Field of Battle ; fo ought they that undertake this facred Adminiftration to be firmly refolved and pre-

pared, not only to perform the feveral Parts of their Office, but to
quit it alfo, if Need be, as becomes

Chriftians ; remembering, that to be depofed for doing one's Duty, isi an honourable Circumftance, and is
attended vAth a Reward in no-wife inferior to the Dignity itfelf And,
wheaever any Pcrfon is a Sufferer in

this Manner, and upon this Account,
becaufe he will not fubmit to any
thing unbecoming and unworthy of
his epifcopal Character, he thereby
brings upon his Depofers a double Punifhment ; but to himfelf he procures a double Reward : For, Blejfed areye^ faith our Lord *, when
Men jhall revile you^ and perfecute
you^ andJhallfay all 7nan7ter of Evil
againft yotCy falfelyy for my Sake.
Rejoice^ and he exceeding glad^ for great is your Reward in Heaven.
This BlejGlng certainly belongs to
them that are deprived by their Col-
legues, through Envy, or to gain the Favour of others, upon fome private Pique, or any other unjuft Motive; for, as for thofe that are
Sufferers in this Manner from tlieir Enemies, I think there is no Need

to £hovv what Gainers they are by
it, nor how greatly the Wickednefs of others contributes to their Ad-
vantage.
Upon the Whole, then, Men
ought to look well about them on all Sides, and fearch diligently, that no Spark of this ambitious Defire lie fmothered up fecretly in the Soul For it is an amiable thing, if even thofe who, from the firft, try to
purge their Hearts from this Difeale,
fhall be able to avoid it, after they
are advanced to this Dignity : But if any one, before he is thus ad-
vanced, nouriflies within his Breaft
this fierce and outrageous Beaft, it
is not pofTible to fay into w^hat a
Depth of Deftru(9:ion fuch a one
precipitates himfelf, after he hath
obtained what he afpired to. Nor
may I conceal my own Weaknefs in

this Refped ; for, indeed, this Dif-
temper of the Mind is what I am too much afflided with myfelf. And think not that, by a pretended Mo-
defty, I would belye myfelf, to raife
your Opinion of me, when I affirm,
that I am too fubjeA to this perni-
cious Defire j and that this very
thing, among feveral others, terri-
fied me, and made me refolve to fly
from the epifcopal Order, For, as
in Cafes of perfonal Fondnefs, the
nearer we are to thofe w^e love, fo much the ftronger and more vehement our Paffion is ; but when wc
are at a Diftance, the Ardour of our Defire abates, and grows cool by Degrees ; juft thus it fares with
thofe that are fond of this facred
Dignity : Set them but near it, and their Defires rage, and become in-
tolerable j whereas, if once they find them-

I42 St. Chr Y S O S T OM
themfelves out of Hopes of it, their Expedation, and their Defire, vanifh together. This, therefore, is a good
Excufe for my Behaviour in this Af-
fair, and a fufficient Reafon, if I had
no other, to keep me at a Diftance
from this honourable Offiee.

bear Injury and Wrong, infolent

Words and biting Scoffs, throv/n

out from our Inferiors, fometim^es

lightly, and in Jeft, at other Times

purpofely, and in Earneft ; to be

loaded with groundlefs Complaints

and unjuft Accufations, as well by

thofe of the firft Rank, as by thofe

of the meaner and bafer Sort ; to
bear thefe Tryals, I fay, with Temper, is not in the Power of many

but it is an Excellence, which only

a very few can arrive at. Nay, one

may fee many Inftances of Perfons

who have Refolution enough to un-

dergo bodily Hardfhips, who, when

they come to experience thefe latter
Sort of Tryals, can preferve no tolerable Decency, but, as if their Senfes were loft, they become fiercer and more furious than any wild
Beaft : And fuch as thefe ought by
no means to be admitted to the
epifcopal Office.
It is not neceffary for the Welfare of the Church, that a Bifliop fliould be eminent for his Abftinence, or
other bodily Mortifications ; nor, if
he is not, will it be of any Diflervice to it. But intemperate Pafiion, and extravagant Ang;er, in a Perfon of
that facred Charafter, are attended with the worft Confequences, both
to himfelf, and to all about him.

who (having no Power to bridle his
Paflion while he lived by himfelf, and was converfant with very few),
when he comes out into the V/orld,

Afts of Arrogance and groundlefs
Hatreds ; it is continually finding
out imaginary Affronts, and caufes
Men both to fpeak and to do many things of an offenfive Nature. And
thus the Soul is hurried away by the irrefiftible Force of this Paffion ; and not having where to fix itfelf, knows

Excellence of my own, but becaufe

The Weaknefs and Unfkilfulnefs of a Combatant may be undifco-
vered, while he ftays at home, and hath no Antagonift to engage with
but when he comes out into the
Field^ it is impoffible to conceal his
Impotence : It will prefently appear
·what he is. Thus the Retirement of
thoie that lead a private and inactive
Life is, as it were, a Veil to cover their
Defeds ; but when once they come
forth into the World, and are forced to throw afide that Veil, the inward PafTions and Difpofitions of
their Mind become, in a manner,
naked, and expofed to public View, by their outward A6lions and Dif-
orders. As, therefore, a right or-

them up to imitate fo good an Example ; fo, on the other hand,
their Vices render thofe, who obferve them, fo much the more in-
difpofed to the Pradtice of Virtue,
ai).d more fluggifh and unapt for the Performance of things excellent and
praife-worthy.
The Soul of a BilTiop, therefore,
ought, by all means, to fhine out fo beautiful and illuftrious with the
Beams of Virtue and Goodnefs, as at once to delight the Eye and aifFect
the Heart of the Spedlators : For the Vices of private Perfons, committed fecretly, and (as it were) in the
Dark, bring Ruin only upon the
A'cftors themfelves ; whereas the
Vices of thofe, that are Men cf
Eminence and high Station, biing univerfal Detriment to all j making

thofe that are negligent of a good
Life, much more fo ; and provoking
thofe that have a Concern for their Souls, to Spiritual Pride^ and to an over-weaning Opinion of themfelves.
Moreover, the Mifcarriages of the
vulgar Sort, though they are public,
give no mortal Wound to Religion but if they fin, who ai*e exalted
to this high Station, not only they themfelves are confpicuous to
all, but the Errors which they are
guilty of, though fmall in Compa-
rifon, appear of a larger Size to the
Eye of the World : And the Reafon
of this is, becauie the World commonly forms its Judgment, in Cafes
of this Nature, not from the Heinoufnefs of the Sin itfelf which is committed, but from the Dignity of
the Perfon, who commits it.

A Bifliop, therefore, ought to be
^rmed on all Sides with Vigilance

and Sobriety, as with a Coat of

Mail, and to look carefully about him, left the Enemy, ^ying any

Advantage, any Place naked and un-

guarded, fhould fix there a deadly
Wound : For, indeed, a Perfon of
that facred Charader is furrounded,

on all Sides, by thofe that are pre-
pared to wound and fupplant him
not only open and avowed Enemies,
but even by thofe who profefs a

FriendlTiip for him,

For this Reafon, they that are

chofen to be Bifliops, ought to have

Souls as invulnerable, as, by the

Gift of God, the Bodies of thofe

* Dan, iii,

their Souls, is not Wood, Pitch, and Tow, or other fuch Cornbuftibles,
but fomething of a more pernicious and deftruftive Nature : Nor, in-
deed, is the Fire itfelf a material
and fenfible Fire, but that moft devouring one of Envy, encircling the Soul, iiaming forth on all Sides, and
penetrating more exquiiitely into
their Lives, than the Babylonijh Fire did into the Bodies or thofe holy
Men ; in v/hich, if it find never fo
little Stubble (never fo few Vices), it immediately catches hold of it, and not only fets the vitiated and rotten Part in a Flam.e, but leaves the reft of the building, though brighter than the Sun before, all over darkened, and fullied with Smoke. For, as long as the Life and Adlions of a Bifhop are uniform, and of a-piece, he is Proof againft all the AiTaults
of

of his Enemies ; but, when once he makes a falfe Step (which muft
fometimes happen, as he is but a
Man, and confequently fubjeft to
human Frailties), all his former Vir-
tues will not be able to fecure him from the evil Tongues of his Ac-
cufers ; but this fmgle Mifcarriage
will caft a Cloud over the reft of
his Excellences. Nor will the Ge-
nerality of Men judge favourably of a Biiliop, or conlider him as a Man
cloathed with the fame Nature as
themfelves ; but cenfure him as it
he were an Ano;eL exalted above
human Infirmities, Thus the Sub-
je<9:s of a Tyrant, as long as he is eftablifhed in his Power, fear and flatter him, becaufe they are not
able to dethrone him; but, when
once his Affairs are unprofperous,

thus it often fares Math a Bifhop :

fo a Bifhop fears thofe chiefly of the

one confiders the SujEIiciency of the
Perfon for whom he votes, nor
makes any Tryal of the Qualifica-

Now, I am fo far from thinking
thefe Caufes fufficient for the Appro-
bation of a Bifhop, that, if any Perfon was propoled, whofe Life was
known to be good (which is, indeed,
a principal Circumftance, and what
ought to weigh very much in this
Cafe), I fhould not dare, even upon this Account, to chufe him imme^
diately, unlefs, befides the Clear-
nefs of his Life, he had alfo a large Share of Prudence and Difcretion.
For, indeed, I myfelf have known many who have been cloiftered in
a Monaftery, and there exercifed
themfelves with Mortifications, who,
as long as they lived thus retired,

their own Souls only, were accept-

fans, when once they came out into

the World, and were obliged to

reftify the Errors of a rude Multi-

tude, fome, from the very hrft, have

given out, as unequal to fo great a
Work ; others, being conftrained to

abide it, have caft away their former Exadneis of Life, by which

they have been great Lofers them-
feives, without bringing any Ad-

vantage thereby to others.
Nay, fuppofe a Man fhould fpend
his whole Life in the loweft Order of the Miniftry, and grow old in the Service of the Church, though I

fhould reverence fuch a one for his

Age,

in Years, be altogether unfit for that
high Charge. Nor do I fpeak this
out of any DifrefpecS: to grey Hairs,
or as if I would exclude all monafti-
cal Perfons from this fpiritual Command (for I muft own that fuch Men
have been fometimes leen to make
a fhining Figure in the epifcopal
Chair), but I do it to iliow, that if neither Piety, nor Length of Years,^ can of themfelves qualify Perfons for the worthy difcharging the Office
of a Bifhop, much lefs can any of
thofe Reafons which I mentioned juft now.
Nay, many are chofen to this high
Dignity upon more abfurd Pretence^ than thefe : Some, left they fhould go over to a contrary Party ; others,

than this ? that Men, full of all Per-

v^^jfenefs and Wickednefs, fhould be

honoured oa the Account of that,

for which they ought to be puniflied;

and afcend to the epifcopal Dignity

for the Sake of thofe Vices, for
which they deferve to be excommu-

nicated, and expelled the Church.

When things of fuch a tremen-

dous and holy Nature are given up

by us, to be thus outraged by yile

Men

Men to be advanced to Dignities
which belong not to them, and for
others to have the Adminiftration of thofe holy Offices committed to
them, which are far beyond their Capacity- and AbiUties? Formerly I remember I was wont to expofe the Princes of this World, who, in filling their Pofts of Honour, had no Regard to the Virtues and Ex-cellences of the Mind, but preferred Men, becaufe they were rich, or advanced in Years, or of noble Dignity : But fince I have heard, that
this unreafonable Practice is intro-
duced even into the Church, I ceafe any longer to think fo fevercly of
the other. For what Wonder is it,
if worldly Men, who defire to be
popular, and will do any thing for Money, fall into thofe Errors, which
even they, that pretend to be free from

^/^^ Priesthood. 169

from thefe Vices, are, upon the whole, no lefs.fubjed to; and they
too, Men that are concerned for^
things of a holy and heavenly Na- ^
ture, for which, neverthelefs, they
have no greater Regard, than for a few fordid Acres ; but chufe vile
Perfons to prelide over thofe facred
Adminiftrations, and to have the
Charge of Mens Souls ; things, for
the Sake of which the only begotten
Son of God was contented to divert
himfelf of his Glory, to be made
Man^ to take upon him the Form of
a Servant^ to be fpit upon^ and buf-
feted * ; nay, to fuffer a moft ignominious Death in the Flefh.
Nor do they flop here, but go
on to commit even greater Abfurdi-
ties than thefe : For they not only
admit Men to the epifcopal Dignity,

wicked Courfes without Controul, and live themfelves as they pleafe, in all poffible Eafe and Security.
If you enquire into the Caufes of this Evil, you will find them pretty
near of kin to thofe which I mentioned before, and that Envy is^^ the Root and Parent of them. '
The Pretences, however, are dif-^^ ferent. One Man muft be rejeded,

can find nothing elfe to allege againft
a Man,, even his Wealth is made an
Objeftion ; and, moreover, that he ought not to be preferred to that Dignity at once, but leifurely, and

they either get thefe ejefted, or in-

that the Cafe of a Bifhop, in this

Tell me now, do I not feem,

after all this, juftly to have refufed

the Adminiftration of this Function?

If not, I have many things more yet
to offer ; let me only befpeak your

Patience for a Friend, that loves you

what I have to urge be ufeful only

for him who defigns to enter uport

vantage he will reap from thence? I anfwer. This, at leaft, if none other, that whenever, at any Time, any of thefe Difficulties befall him,
he may not be a Stranger to them,
but be prepared, and well inftruded
how to encounter them wifely. And now, which fhall I firft
treat of, the Management of the poor Widows *, or the Superintend
dency of the religious Virgins, or thofe Difficulties which arife to a Bifbop from judicial Proceedings ? For, indeed, a particular Care attends every one of thefe Duties, and a Fear fuperior to that.-
To

To begin, then, with that which,
feems eafier and Hghter than the reft,
i mean, the Management of the poor Widows : This appears, at firft
View, to bring Httle other Care along with it, than that of laying
out the Church's Money; but, in
Truth, it is quite otherwife. For, as often as any are to be chofen into
that Society, much Dihgence is neceffary, to make Enquiry into the
Charaders of them ; the chufing of fuch Perfons, without due Care,
havdng been the Caufe of infinite Mifchiefs : For by fuch Perfons
Families have been corrupted, Marriages diffolved, and they have often given themfelves up to Stealing, and
other diforderly and fhameful Prac-

tices.

be pleafed to fee thofe Benefadions,
which were deiigned for the Ho-
nour of Chrift, confumed in main-
taining People, who are a conftant
Reproach and Difhonour to his holy
Name ? There ought, therefore, to
be diligent Enquiry made, not only
to keep off all fuch as I have mentioned already^ but others alfo^ who,
being able to maintain themfelves, ought not to devour the things
which were defigned for the Suf-
tenance of thofe who are not able. Nor is this the only Inftance where
Circumfpedion is requifite: After the beft Search and Examination, there is flill no lefs Care neceflary,
that.

that the Fountain of Charity flow freely to them, and that their A1--

lowances be not wanting, nor fall

(hort : For, indeed, involuntary Po-

rerty is an infatiable Evil, thanklefs,
and full of Murmur ; and there is Need of no fmall Share of Prudence

and Diligence to flop their Mouths,

and take away from them all Occa-

iion of Complaint.

^.Now, there are many who think,
that if a Man be but generous, he is

forthwith quaHfied for this Province

but I cannot think that this Great-

nefs of Mind is of itfelf fufficient

Though, I muft own, a Perfon in

that Office ought efpecially to be

endued with this Excellence (for

without it he would be a Deftroyer,

rather than a Ruler, and a Wolf,

inftead of a Shepherd) : But, befides

this, there is another Virtue requiiite,

N3

I mean^

i82 St, ChrysostojvI
I mean, Patiencej that Caufe of much Good to Man ; which is, as it were,
a Port, in which the Soul is kept fafe from Storms and Tempefts. For,
indeed, that Clafs of Women, either
on account of their Poverty, their
Years, or their natural Inclinatiou (to fpeak the mof!: favourably), af-
fume an immoderate Liberty of being importunately clamorous, and
of complaining withptit Caufe :
Thofe things, which fhould be the
Subject of their Gratitude, they make
Matter of Lamentation ; and inftead of being thankful for what they have, they find Fault with it.
All thefe things a Bifhop muft bear manfully, and not be provoked, either by their unfeafonable Irriper« tinence, or their unreafonable Queruloufnefs. And, truly, the unhappy Condition of thofe poor Creatures
ought

i?/'//^^ Priesthood, 183

ought rather to move his Pity thaq his Anger. It would be cruel and
inhuman, in the laft Degree, to infult their Calamity, and to increafe the Miferies of their Poverty, by adding thereto Scorn and Reproach* For this Reafon, confidering the Covetoufnefs and Pride of Mankind, and the Nature and Force of Po-
verty, how apt it is to overwhelm
the mofl: generous Soul, and to
tempt Perfons to make importunate Requefts, even to a. Degree of Im^
pudence, to the end, that, by fuch
reftlefs Sollicitations, he, who ought
to relieve the Poor, fliould not be
fxafperated, and made an Enemy,
a very wife Man inftruds him to

And fo, paffing from the Impor-

to him who is able to bear his
Infirmities, and exhorts him, before he gives an Alms, to raiie the poor Man's Spirits with kind
'Looks, and good Words ^. For
though a Man doth not with-hold
his Alms, yet if he is injurious "with his Tongue, loading the Poor
v/ith many Reproaches, and fhow-
ing himfelf highly enraged againft
them, he is fo far from leffening the 'Grievance of their Poverty by what he gives them, that he aggravates their Mifery, by the Bitternefs of his Language.

And, no doubt, it is a doubly Misfortune to fuch unhappy Perfons,
firft, that they are conftrained to be clamorous and preffing, through the
pinching NecefTity of Hunger ; and
next, that being driven to thefe Straits, they are reproached for
it: Fgr while, to prevent ftarving, they are forced to beg, and in begging are obliged to put on a bold Face, and, for fo doing, are con-
tumelioufly ufed, how can it be,
:
but that a various and difmal Scene of Sadnefs and Defppndency muft overwhelm the Soul ?
He, therefore, that hath the Care of the Poor, ought to have a good Share of Patience towards them; not only not to add Sorrow to Sor-
row, by any Peeviflinefs pf his own
but alfo, by his courteous Behaviour, to fpfteu and alleviate thofe Troubles
which

it, when it comes to him foured

with Taunts and Reproaches ; fo

when a feafonable Relief is attended

with Words of Confolation, the

Heart of the poor Man is highly re-^
joiced; and the kind Way of be-

ftowing fuch a Charity makes the

Charity itfelf doubly welcome. Nor

one who, being eijtrufted with the
Adminiftration ofthis Office, amaffed
a conliderable Sum ; which, it is true,
,he did not {quander upon himfelf;
nor did he apply it, except a very little, to the Ufe of the Poor ; but
hid it in the Earth, till troublefome

the CoUeftions for the Poor neither exceed nor fall fhort, but that all Contributions be fpeedily diftributed as Occafion requires, and that the
Treafurcs of the Church be laid up
in the charitable Diipofitioris of the
People.
^ The Entertaining of Strangers,
and the taking Care of the Sick, is another Article which requires great Expence, and no lefs Diligence and Prudence from thofe whofe Province
it is. The Sums of Money laid out
on this Occafion are by no means
inferior, nay often much greater,
than thofe already mentioned : And, for this Caufe, the Perfon, whofe

difficult, and hard to be pleafed ;

ought by no means to indulge herfelf in any of thefe things. Parti-
cularly, fhe fhould avoid all fre-
quent and unnecefTary rambling abroad, all vain and foolilh Dif-
courfe, and the very Names of Flat-
tery or P^eviling fhould not be fo
much as known to her. And, for
this Caufe, there fhould be the
flrider Watch, and a greater Guard, kept over fuch Perfons. For that
wicked Spirit, who is a profefied Enemy to their Kolinefs, is always
at

into which if any of them fall, hd

Men alfo are, on all Sides, watching

what is yet more, they have the
Exorbitances of their own corrupt
Nature to deal with. So that the
holy Virgin hath a double Enemy to arm herfelf againft, him who attacks her from without, and him who
tempts her from within. He, therefore, that hath the
Care of thefe Virgins, cannot but be in conftant Fear, Danger, and Trouble, left, by fome Misfortune

quence of that Hatred will be infinitely worfe, even the fuffering of everlafting Punifhment.
Befidesj the natural Father hath
many Advantages of keeping his Daughter within Bounds : Her Mo-
tlier, her Nurfe, the Multitude of Servants, and the Security of the
Houfe, do all contribute to render this no difficult Matter for him :

her of appearing in public* In all

Cafes, her Father is her Guard and

Protedor ; and fhe hath only this one Care incumbent on her, not to

fay or do any thing unworthy of

or unbecoming the Charader of %

But now, in the Cafe of the holy

Virgins, and their fpiritual Father,

there are many things which render

it very difficult, if not impoffible,
for him to keep a flrid Watch over

them. For he cannot have them at

home with him, under his own Eye;

fuch a Cohabitation would neither

be decent nor fafe : And, though

O ;?

there

there were no real Hurt in it, but they did, on both Sides, preferve their Sandity untouched, yet would
they be accountable for the Scandal
they gave, no lefs than if they had been actually faulty towards one another. Such a Cohabitation, therefore, being impracticable, it muft
of Confequence be fo much the
harder for a Bifhop, to find out and obferve the feveral Inclinations and
Difpofitions of thofe Virgins, to corre6l the Diforders of fome, to
exercife and improv^e the Virtues of others, and to difcover the Haunts of thofe that are addifted to ramble abroad. There is efpecially one Circumflance which hinders a Biihop from examining nicely into the Behaviour of fuch Perfons ; and that is, where the Virgin is poor,
and at her own Difpofal. For there
fhe

Occaiions and Pretences, if fhe is fo

he that will oblige fuch a one to live

always retired, miift firft remove all

thofe Pretences, by furnifhing her

with a Competency of all Necef-

Matter of Labour and Difficulty
alone, but it is attended v/ith much
Danger alfo, as appears from the Behaviour of fome weak Perfons,
who being in Trouble, and not
having any to undertake their Caufe,
have immediately made Shipv^/reck
Way of their Faith. For it is the
of fome People, when they are in-
jured, to bear as fi:rong Refentment

Iniquity of the Times, for the Me-

thing whatfoever ; but are impla-
cable Judges in their own Cafe,
thinking their Deliverance from thofe Evils which they feel a fuffi-
cient Apology and Excufe. And he who is not able to procure this
for them, though he have ever fo
many Reafons to urge in his own
Behalf, will be fure not to efcape the Severity of their Lafh.
And here, fince I have mentioned
this Subjedt of Patronage, I will
proceed to fhow you another thing, which often becomes the Oc-
calion of much Blame, and many
Complaints, to a Bifhop. For, un-
lefs he is every Day more conftant
in viiiting his People, than thofe
w^hofe

202 St. Chrysostom
whofe only Employment is walking
about, even from hence will arife unfpeakable Offence: For not the Sick only expect to be attended by him, but thofe alfo that are well;
^d this not out of any religious
Principle, but merely for State, and
to -have Refped fhown them. And
if^ at any Time, it happens that,
for the common Good and Intereft
of the Church, he is more frequent than ufual in his Vilits to fome one
of the wealthier and greater Sort, prefently he is accufed of Flattery and artful Addrefs.
But why do I fpeak of thefe Cafes
of Patronage and Yiliting ? fince,
evjen from bare Salutations and com-
mon Civilities, fuch Imputations are
t-hrown on a Biiliop, as are enough to overwhelm his Mind, and fink him with Defpondency. Nay, even

Bifhop, indeed, ought

to have no Accufers ; but, if that is

not poiliblc, the next thing delire-

able is to be able to wipe off thofe

Calumnies which are caft upon him

But, if it be a difficult thing to do
this alfo, £nce Tome Men take a

lingular Pleafure in railing vile Re-

prefentations out of nothing, the

only thing that remains to be

done in fuch a Cafe, is to bear up manfully, and with a good

Courage, as it were in Contempt

and Defiance of fuch Accufations,

For, truly, he that knows himfelf

to be juftly accufed of any Crime,

may, for that very Caufe, the. more

eaiily bear with his Accufer : For,
having at the fame Time a more

mean, his own Confcience ; and
being firft of all taxed and con-
demned by that inward and mofl troublefome Witnefs, he the more
patiently endures the Blame of thofe
without, as the gentler and much
more tolerable of the two. But when an innocent Perfon is
wrongfully accufed, he is fo much
the fooner tranfported with Anger,
and is fo much the more apt to fall
into Defpondency, unlefs he have
firft of all armed himfelf againft thefe things, and is prepared to bear
with Patience the Folly of others:' For, indeed, it is hardly poflible, I muft repeat it, it is hardly poflible

faid, to what Purpofe fhould I yet farther add that Grief and Trouble
of Mind which a Bifhop muft undergo, when he is obliged to cut
ofF any Oflfender from the Com-
munion of the Church ; the Effeft of which, it were to be wifhed went no farther than Grief, but it too
often terminates in Deftrudion, and that no light one neither : For it is
to be feared, left fuch a Sinner, being
fometimes punifhed in this Manner, beyond what is requifite, fhould fall into the Condition mentioned by St^ Paul *, and l^e fwallowed up with overmuch Sorrow. Great Care fhould be taken, therefore, in this Matter^

left that, which was deiigned for the Sinner's Recovery and Advantage, become to him an Occaiion of fallinor into a deeper and more deplorable Condemnation.
No lefs Care fhould be taken, on
the other hand, that the Wounds of
the Soul be not fearched, without
going to the Bottom of them ; for
the fpiritual Surgeon, who manages
the Soul in this Manner, muft cer-
tainly partake of the Wrath due to thofe Sins, which break out upon
the Soul of the Sinner, after fuch an imperfect Cure.
And how fore muft his Punifhtnent be, who muft be anfwerable
not only for the Sins which he is
guilty of himfelf, but for thofe alfo
which others commit ? For, if we
juftly dread to give an Account for our

2o8 St. Chrysostom

our own Sins, as being unable, in fo

doing, to efcape the Pains of Hell,
what muft he exped, who muft ren~

der an Account for fuch Multitudes

Terror of this Threatening appear

CHAPTER I.
MY Friend having heard this, after a little Faufe, thus replied. Basil. If, indeed, you had ambitioufly
afFefted this facred Dignity, there had been fome Foundation for this Fear For he that, by aiming at it, con-
felles himfelf capable of fo weighty an Adminiftration , if he prove
deficient therein, after it is committed to his Charge, hath no room
to plead Inexperience in his Excufe.
By his affuming the Office, he
cuts hinifelf off fvQpi this Pretence :
Nor

of the Priesthood, 211

Nor can he, who comes to it vo-

luntarily, and with an afpiring

Mind, fay in his own Behalf, " I have " finned in this Matter much againft

my "

Will : I have loft fuch a Soul

" altogether againft my own Incli-

" nations." For, in this Cafe, he

that fhall one Day judge fuch a one,

will fay to him, " Why then, when

you was confcious to yourfelf of
your own Inexperience, and that

you had not fufficient Abilities

'^ for the unblameable Adminiftra-

'^ tion of this Fundtion, did you

<c thus prefume to undertake what

cc was fo far above your Power ?

Who cc

obliged you to it ? Did you

cc fhun, and fly from it, and was you

cc drawn back again by Force ?" But

nothing of this Nature can be ob-

jefted

to

you ;

you

w^ill

have nothing

P2

of

212 St.Chrysostom

of this Kind to condemn yourfclf

for ; lince it is notorious to all, that

you have, in no Degree, follicited

this Honour, but it was offered you

by the Judgment and Determination

of others. So that every thing which

excludes thofe prefumptuous Af-

fumers of that high Office from all

Excufe and Pardon, might have

ferved to furnifh you abundantly

with both.

I fmiled a little at this, and,
fhaking my Head at the plain Sim-

plicity of the Man, replied thus.

Chrysostom.

I could wifh, indeed, that it were

O as you fay,

thou beft of Men !

though not oh my own Account, or

that I might have an Opportunity of accepting that Office which I fo lately fled from : For, if it were fo, that I was to exped: no Punifhment,

though

of the Priesthood. 213

though I was carelefs and unfkilful
in my Management of Chrift's Flock, yet it would be worfe to me than all
Punifhment, to confider how far
my Adminiftration of that excellent
OiEce fell fhort, and, indeed, was utterly unworthy of the Dignity of
him who committed it to my Care.
For what Reafon, then, do you think that I could wifh you was not miftaken in your Opinion of this Matter ? Truly for the Sake of thoie miferable and unhappy Perfons (for
fuch I muft call them), who have
no Skill or Underftanding for the due Difcharge of this high Office

(though you pretend never fo often that they were forced to it, and

therefore, that their Errors herein

are Sins of Ignorance), I fay, I could

wifh it for their Sakes, that fo they

might, by this means, efcape that

P3

un-

214 St. Chrysostom

unquenchable Fire, that utter Dark-
nefs, the never-dying Worm, the
being cut in funder, and the. having their Portion with Hypocrites and
Unbehevers.
But what {hall I fay ? It is not
fo ; it is by no means fo. And of
this, if you pleafe, I w^ill give you a plain Proof, from the Cafe of a
Kingdom, for which, however, God
never expreffed that Regard, which he hath for the Priefthood.
Saul^ for Inftance, that Son of Kifo *, was not ftudioully ambitious
of being a King, He was in Pur--
fuit of his loft AfTes ; and for thofe
only it w^as, that he came to en--
quire ; though Samuel^ indeed, gave hiai Tidings of the Kingdom. But neither ^ven then did he haften to obtain that high Dignity, though

'^ 1 Sart\ 1X4

promifed it by the Mouth of a Pro-
phet ; but he fhunned and declined
it, faying, W^o am IP and what is
my Father s Houfef
But now, give me Leave to aflc When Saul afterwards abufed that

Power, with which he was invefted
by God, are thofe Words of his fufhcient to flcreen him from the Wrath
of God, by whom he had been fo
highly exalted? Or, when Sa?nuel

reproved him for his Male-adminiftration, had he any Room, by way of Excufe, thus to reply to him :
What would you hav^e ? Did I aiFed the Kingdom ? Was I
eagerly defirous of the regal.
Pov/er ? No : It was my Defire

to have kept myfelf in a private

Station. I had led a quiet an^

inadive Life, had you not dragged

me out to this Dignity : In which

P4

^' humble

:
2i6 St. Chry s OS TOM
^^ humble State had I continued, " I Ihould eafily have avoided all
*' thefe Mifdemeanors. Had I fkill
" been one of the obfcure Multi^^ tude, I had not been fent on this
Expedition ; nor had God com-
mitted to my Management the
War againft xhtAmalekiteSy which
had I not engaged in, I had never ^^ committed fuch an Offence?"
But all thefe Pleas v^ould have been infujfficient for his Excufe Nay, not only infufficient, but dangerous ; inafmuch as they v/ould have tended the more to excite
God's Wrath againft him. For, in-
deed, he that is advanced to any Office beyond his Merit, inftead of making the Greatnefs of his Dignity an Excufe for his Errors therein,
ought to make God's efpecial Favour towards him an Occalion of
greater

:

greater Improvement in Virtue Whereas he that, from the Excel-knee of his Dignity, thiifks himfelf
fo much the more at Liberty to fin,
what does he thereby, but charge

the Divine Benevolence as the Caufe

A of his Wickednefs ?

Practice very

common with thofe who give them-

felves up to an ungodly and fenfual

Life. But we, for our Part, ought by no means to be thus difpofed, nor to fall into the fame Madnefs

with fuch Perfons, but endeavour, at all Times, to have a due Govern-
ment over thofe things, which pro-
ceed from ourfelves, that we neither

fpeak nor think diflionourably of

God.

For (to leave the Cafe of a Kingdom, and proceed to that of the
Priefthood, which is the more imme-
diate Subjeft of our prefent Difcourfe)
neither

2i8 St. Chrysostom
neither did Eli afpire to that high
Office. Yet what Advantage was
it to him, when he iinned, in the ill Execution thereof? But why do
I fay afpire? when, it is plain, he could not have avoided it, if he
would : He was under a legal Ne-
ceffity to accept it. For he was of the Tribe of Levt^ and was, for
that Reafon, obliged to undertake
that high Office, which defcended to him from his Anceftors, And,
neverthelefs, we find how feverely
he was puniffied for the infolent Diforders of his Sons. Nay, even
Aaron himfelf, the firft High-Priefb
of the Jews^ concerning whom God
fpoke fo many things to Mofes ; be-
caufe, in the Bufinefs of the golden Call, he alone could not withftand the Madnefs of fo great a Multi-

Brother interpofed in his Behalf.
And here, fince we have men-

tioned MofeSy it will not be impro-
per to' confirm the Truth of my

Pofition, even from what happened

to this great Man. For this excel-

lent Perfon was fo far from afpiring

to the Government of the Jews^ that,
when it was offered him, though God commanded him to accept of

it -f, he refufed ; infomuch, that
God was angry with him. And

afterwards, when he had undertaken

it, he would gladly have died, to

have been difcharged from it : If

This was the Caufe why that ad-

From hence, then, you fee plainly, that not only they who afpire to thi^
Dignity, are deftitute of all Excufe
for the Errors they commit in the
Male-adminiftration thereof, but
even they alfo, who come to it by
the Appointment of others. For,

truly, if thofe Perfons, that have been chofen to this high Office by
God himfelf^ though they have never

fo often refufed it, have, neverthelefs been feverely punifhed for their

becaufe many of the Ordinations

Money, which he fliould have laid
out well, did he, therefore, efcape
with Impunity ? No ; fo far from
this, that he thereby wrought for
himfelf a much forer and more
grievous Punifliment ; and that too
very defervedly. For, furely, it
would very ill become us to make
thofe Honours and Preferments, to
which God exalts us, Occafions of abuiing and offending him : They
fhould rather be fo manj^' Obliga-
tions upon us, to endeavour the
more to pleafe him. And he who
thinks he fhall efcape unpunillwed for his Sins, becaufe he is exalted to an higher Station than others, a6ts juft fuch a Part as an unbelieving

plying, " Why then did you come,

" do thefe Works ? Was it, that
*' our Punifhrnent jQiould be fo
" much the greater?"
The Man who fliould argue thus,
might juftly be deemed mad. For
certainly a Phyfician attends, not to give the Patient over, but to recover
him ; not to negled: his Cafe, but completely to cure him. But then, if you that are flck wilfully withdraw yourfelf from the Hands of your Phyfician, you are to expeil a heavier Condemnation : For as you would have been healed of your former Maladies, had you fabmitted to

you are fure to fufler Puniflitnent, not for them only, but alfo
becaufe yoii rendered vain, as fat

follows, that Men are to expeft much greater and more fevere Pu-»

w^culd infer irom hence, that they,
who are honoured with it, without
feeking for it, are therefore the more pardonable for the Errors they com-

mit in the Execution of it ; for, it

is very fure, that even they are de-

treated and importuned ever fo vmuch, he ought not to regard that

in this Matter, but, firft of all, to
fearch diligently into himfelf, and

not to yield to the mofl prefling Im-

Will a Man undertake to build, who

who hath no manner of Skill or

Knowledge in Phyfic? or, though
fuch a one fliould be much impor-

tuned, would he not politively per-

afhamed to own his Ignorance ? And fhall not he much rather dili-

gently confider and examine him-
felf, to whom the Care of fo many

this the ready Way to caft both him-

felf and them too headlong into De-
ftruilion ? He might poffibly have

faved himfelf, had he continued as he

was (that is, in his private Station)

but now he draws others along with

him into Ruin: For from whence
is there Room to hope for Safety,

or to expeft Pardon ? In fuch a

Cafe as this, who will deprecate our

Puniihment, or intreat for us ? Will

they that importuned and even

To all this I need not add what, no doubt, you well

know that that Body which I am

our own natural Fieih ; and that as

to be recovered. For they that have the Cure of thefe our natural Bodies,
have many Advantages^ great Di-
verfity of Medicines, no lefs a Variety of Inftruments, and a Diet, proper and fuitable for the Patient; even the fole Temperament of the Air
is fometimes fufficient to reftore Health ; nay, a feafonable Slumber
hath, at other Times, had the fame happy Effed, and faved the Phy-
lician all farther Labour.
But, in the fpiritual Cure of the
Body of Chrifl, none of thefe Ad-
vantages are to be met with. There is but one Method, there is but one Way, of recovering us after our evil Deeds ; and that is, by the Doctrine of the Divine Word. That is the
Inftrument; that, the Diet; that, the
heft Temperament of Air; that fup~
phes the r lace of Phylic. If there be
Need

Need of fearing, that is the befl Cauftic : That is the befl: Incifton-knife, if there be Need of Amputation. This is what we mufl: make ufe of

in all thefe Cafes ; and if this doth

not effed:ually work a Cure, nothing

will. For, by this, the Soul is raifed

tip from a drooping and languifliing

State · by this, when it is blown up

with Vanity, thofe Swellings and

Tumors are repreffed ; by this, we

cut off from it all Superfluities, and

fupply all Defeds : And, in a Word,

this is the Inftrument by which we

perform all other Operations which

are requifite for the Welfare and

Health of the Soul.

m It is true, indeed,

refped: of

our Morals, that the good Life of

another Perfon may provoke us to

Emulation ; and it is poilible for us

to arrive at a ntoft excellent V^^ay of

R2

Living,

Living, bv the Influence of our
Neighbour's Example. But when

the Soul is infefted with fpurious and heretical Opinions, there is then great NeceiTity for the Application
of this Divine Word of Dodrine; and that, to keep our own People

clear of that Infedion, as v/ell as to
oppofe and encounter the Enemy.
Nay, if a Man were armed with the
Sword of the Spirit^ a77d with the
Shield of Faith *, fo as to be able to
work Miracles, and, by thofe Miracles, to flop the Mouths of fhameIcfs and impudent Gainfayers, fuch a Perfon (one would think) fhould have the lefs Need of the Afliftance

ferent Attacks, to underPcand all

the Part of a fuperior and inferior
Officer ; of a common Centinel, or a Commander ; on Foot, or on Horie-
back ; in a Fight by Sea, or a Siege

by Land. For it is not here as in
common Battles, in which, if every

one maintains that fingle Pofi: which

is affigned him, it is fufficient to
repell the Enemy : But he that dc-
fires to come off a Conqueror in this

fpiritual Warfare, muft underftand

all the Strataorems and Contrivances

thereof; or elfe the Devil, where-

ever he fpies any one Place un-

guarded and neglected, will there

throw in his Forces to dellroy the

R4

Flock

248 St. Ch R Y S O S T O M
Flock of Chrift : But this he cannot do, where he perceives the Shepherd coming againft him, well inftruded and fully apprifed of all his Snares
and Deceits. For this Caufe, we
ought to be well guarded in all Parts : For our Cafe is not unlike that of a City, which, as long as it is encompafled, on. all Sides by a ftrong Wall, continues fafe, and laughs at her Befiegers ; but if
once a fmall Breach be made in it,
though but of the Bignefs of a Gate, the Remainder of the Wall, let it ftand never fo firm, will be of little Ufe or Service to it. Juft thus it
fares with the City of God ; fo long as the Wifdom and Vigilance of the
Pafloj' encompaffes her on all Sides, as with a Wall, all hcftile Attempts
of an Enemy will end in his own
Shame and Difgrace, while the In-
habitants

^/)6^ Priesthood. 24^

habitants remain fafe and unmoleftcd within ; but if once any fingle Part of it be demoliihed, though the reft ftand never fo faft, yet, through that
Breach, Ruin and Devaftation will enter upon the Whole.

Thus, to what Purpofe doth a
Man argue fuccefsfully againft the

Gentiles^ if, at the fame Time, he

becomes a Prey to the Jews? or, what Advantage is it for him to be a powerful Difputer againft them

both, if the Manichees are too power-
ful for him ? or, fuppofing him too hard for them alfo, what fhall he be

the better for it, if the Fatalifts and Deftinarians break in upon him, and
^ake Ravage and Havock of the

Flock ? But, not to enumerate all the feveral Herefies which the Devil

hath introduced, it will be fufficient

to fay, that, unlefs a Paftor is fin-

250 St. ChR Y S OS TOM
gularly well fkilled in refuting them all, any one of them will fet open a Door foi" the Wolf to enter, and de-
vour many of the Sheep of Chrift. Befides, we may obferve, rhat, in
martial Engagements, the Vidory is commonly obtained, and the Defeat given, by thofe Soldiers that ftand their Ground, and fight bravely. But in thefe fpiritual Combats, it is
quite otherwife : For, here, it often-
timxcs falls out, that v/hile fome are contending, others, that fit ftili, and take no Pains, enjoy the Victory. This is the Cafe of any raw and unexperienced Difputant, who, like a
Soldier that hath his oWn Weapons
turned upon him, becomes ridi^culous both to Friends and Foes; Shall I make this plain to you, by
an Example ? The Inftance, then, that I will give you is this. They
who

;
of the Priesthood. 251 who receive the wild Docftrines of
Valentifiiis and Marcion^ rejed out of the Catalogue of the Divine Writ-
ings, the Law which was given by-
God to Mofes. On the other hand*
the Jews fo highly honour it, that
they contend for the Obfervance of
all therein commanded, though the
Time for thole things being now ex-
pired, fuch an Obfervance would be contrary to the Will of God. But
now the Church, avoidino; both thefe
Extremes, takes the middle Way
teaching, that though we are not
any longer to fubmit our Necks to
that Yoke, yet that the Law itfelf
ought not to be evil-fpoken of; and
thouQ-h the Obligation thereto is
now at an End, yet we praife it for
its Ufefulnefs formerly, while it re-
mained in force. He, therefore, that is to engage with thefe two
Enemies,

252 St. Chrys osTOA^

Enemies, ought, by all means, to

underftand this Medium : For if, being defirous to fliovv the Jews how

unfeafonably they are now attached

to the old Law, we fall upon it un-

mercifully, and declaim againfl: it

immoderately, we fhould give no

little Handle of Obloquy to thofe

On Heretics to rail againft it.

the

other Side, if, to flop their Mouths,

we extoil it beyond Meafure, and

run into large Encomiums upon it,

as a thing neceffary even now, then
we give as great a Handle to the yews^ as we had before given to the

Heretics.
Again, they who embrace the mad Notions of Sabellius^ or ArhiSy
do both of them fall from theSoundnefs of the Faith, for want of observing a due Mean. Both thofe
Heretics, indeed, are called CZ^r/-

Jlians ;

of the Priesthood. 25;^
jiians ; but, if you enquire into their Dodrines, you will find the
one not much better than the yer^Sy
and little dilFering from them, ex-
cept in Name ; and the others
very much refembHng the Herefy
of Paul of Samofata ; and both of them exceedingly deviating from
the Truth;
Great, therefore, is the Danger
in this Refpedl. The Truth lies in a ftrait and narrow Way, between
two fteep Precipices;- and there is
Reafon to fear, left, \^ilft we fight
fuccefsfuUy againft the one Sort of
Heretics, we ourfelves be wounded by the other. For if we aflert the Unity
of the Godhead, immediately Sabel-
lius draws that Exprefiion to his own
impious Senfe. On the other hand,
if we make a Diftinftion, and fay,
that the Father is one, the Son an-
other,

^54 ^^' Chrysostom
other, and the Holy Ghoft anothef,'
Arius is ready to wreft that Diftinction of Perfons into a Difference of
Subftance. And it equally concerns
us to avoid the impious Confuiiori
of the one, and the mad Diverfity
of the other, by confeffing the Godhead of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghoft, to be all one, and by adding thereunto a Trinity of Perfons : For
thus fhall we fortify ourfelves againft:
both their Affaults.
Befides thefe, I might here reckon up to you feveral other Adverfaries,-

when adminiftred by wife and good Men. Would you know what this
is ? In fliort, it is Preaching ; it is
that great Labour which is employed in pubHc Sermons.

For, in the firft Place, the

greater Part of Auditors will not

difpofe themfelves to hearken to the
Preachers as to Perfons from whom

they fhould le^rn; but, difdaining
the Rank of Dlfciples, they take
upon them to ad: the Part of thofe

rather that are Spedlators at the
public Games ; and as there the
Multitude is feparated into Parties,
and fome join themfelves to one, and fome to another; fo here alio they are divided, fome run after one Preacher, and fome after another, according as they are carried away

by Flavour or Difaffedion,

Nor

:
284 St. Chry s o s T OM
Nor is this the only Misfortune
There is another attends this Matter, not at all inferior to it. For if a Preacher makes ufe of any Part of
another Man's Works in his Sermon, the borrowing of fo many Words will be deemed a greater Difgrace
to him, than if he had ftolen fo much Money j nay, fometimes the bare
Sufpicion of fuch a thing will do it,
though the Man be innocent.
But why do I mention the Op-
probrium of other Mens Works, when a Preacher is not allowed,
without great Variety, to ufe his
own ? For many People hear Ser--
mons now--a-days, juft as they go
to Plays and Concerts, not for Edification, but Diverfion ; and that Eloquence which I fo declaimed
againft juft now, is as much ex-
pected in the Pulpit as at the Bar.

A Man, therefore, fliould have a
good Prefence of Mind, far beyond what I can pretend to, to reftrain this diforderly and unprofitable Pleafure
of the Multitude, and to bring them
to a more ufeful Way of Hearing
that they may follow and obey his
Dodrines, and he not be tofled about
and difquieted by their Humours
and Fancies. But this is not to be
effefted, but only by thefe two things, a Contempt of Praife, and
the Art of Preaching well.
CHAP. IL
ONE of thefe, without xkt other, will not do : For if a Preacher can overlook the Applaufe of his Auditors, and is not able, at the fame Time, to entertain thenx
with found Doftrine, feafo?ted wkh
the

;
286 St. Chrysostom
//je Salt of Grace ^'^ his Greatnefs of
Mind will be of no Service to him,
but he will fall into a general Dif-
efteem : So, on the other hand, if he preaches ever fo well, yet if he
is overcome by a vain Delire of Ap-
plaufe, he brings no lefs Inconveniences to himfelf and his Hearers
becaufe, on this Account, he endeavours to form his Diicourfes more
to obtain their Favour and Praife,
than to do them Good.
And thus, as he who neither de-
lires the Praife of his Hearers, nor
knows how to manage a Difcourfe,
can neither pleafe their Ears, nor
profit their Souls ; juft fo it fares?
with that Preacher, who, carried away with a Defire of Applaufe,

A Bis HOP, therefore, that v/ill aft up to his Charader, muft
be powerful in both thefe RefpecSs,
left the Want of the one fhouid ren--
der the other inefFeftual. For if,
when he afcends the Pulpit, and
iharply inveighs againft the Vices of.
wicked Men, he fhould faulter and

Want of Fluency of Speech, be

to reply, gladly lay hold of this
Accident, under which to veil their

A Preacher, therefore, not unlike
a fkilful Charioteer, ought to drive fteadily between thefe two Excel-
lences, that he may be able to ufe
either of them, as Occaiion fhall
require: And when, in both thefe
Refpeds, he fhall be irreproachable himfeif, he will then be able, with
the greater Authority, to cenfurc or
remitt the Sins of thofe under his
Care, which otherwife he would
find it difficult to do. Nor ought this Greatnefs of Mind to be limited

much the Labour of a Reclufe ; but, if we compare the Fa-
tigues of that Order of Men with
thofe of the Paftoral Duty, we fliall find as much Difference between
the one and the other, as there
is between the Bufinefs of a King
and a private Perfon. For there, though the Labour be much, yet it
lies in common between the Body
and the Soul ; or rather, the greater
Part of it confifts in Exercifes of the
Body, which, unlefs it be hale and
robuft,

robuftj though the Will be ever fo

good, yet can it not proceed unto

Aftion: (For long Fafts, lying on

the Ground, watching in the Night,

the Difufe of Baths, and other

Mortifications, which they pradlife

to afflid the Body, muft all fall of

courfe, where, through Infirmity,

it is not able to undergo fuch Dif-

cipline.) But here, Purity of Soul

is the thing chiefly required : Nor

is a good Habit of Body neceffary

to fet off the Virtues of the Mind

For what doth a vigorous Confti-

tution of Body contribute towards

our being not felf- willed, not

Befides, they are obliged to conftant
Labour, for the Sake of Food and Raiment ; lince they think themfelves obliged to do every thing with
their own Hands. But a Bifliop hath
no Need to take fuch Pains ; but he is,
without Scruple, promifcuoufly converfant with all things that are not
hurtful, having, in the mean Time,
all his Excellency repofited in the
Treafures of his Soul. But if any lone admires a monaftic Life, and
thinks it a great thing to be able to fhun the Converfation of the Multitude, I fhall not deny that it is, irt-

THERE is no Reafon, there-
fore, fo exceedingly to admire the Virtue of a Reclufe, or to think it fo extraordinary a thing for him, while he lives alone, to pre-
ferve himfelf free from the Diforders
of Paflion, and from many and great
Oflences ; for he hath no Provocations to the one, nor Temptations to the other. But if he that lives
in

tf the Priesthood, 335
in a Crowd, and is obliged to bear the Sins of many, can, in the midfl of fuch a Storm, keep his Soul fteady and firm, as in a Calm, fuch a one ought to be extolled and applauded beyond others, having given fufficient Proof of his Fortitude and
Virtue.
Wonder not, therefore, at me, if I, who fhun the Forum^ and all
Places of public Refort, have not
many Accufers. Wonder not at it
any more, than you would do, that
while I am aileep, I do not fin; or that while I wreftle not, I am not
thrown down; or that while I do not
fight, I am not conquered. Who, I befeech you, can be my Accufer ?
Who can difcover or declare the
Follies I commit ? Can the Roof under which I fit, or the Chamber in which I lludy ? No; they cannot,
they

they have not the Power of Speech.
Or my Mother, to whom I am moft

intimately known, will Ihe, do you
think, difclofe the Vices I am guilty

of? But our Interefts have never

interfered, nor has any Quarrel hap-

pened between us : And, if this

Ihould happen, yet I do not think

that there is any Mother fo void of

natural Affedion, or that hath fo

whom little Love for the Son,

flie

hath brought forth witli Pain, and

educated with Care, as, without any

Neceffity, to fpeak Evil of him,

and accufe him to the World. But,

neverthelefs, if any one would make
diligent Examination into my Soul,

he would find there many Follies

and Corruptions ; nor would you

yourfelf be able to deny it, in Ipite

of all thofe Encomiums with which

you

hf the Priesthood. 337

you beyond others have been accufiomed to lold me.

And thkt I do ilot fay this to de-
trad from the paftoral Office, you

will eafily judge, if yoil recoiled: what^
you have heard me fay, when we have

been difcourfing on this Subject, as we frequently have, how that if I rriight
have my Choice, whether I would

defire to be eminent in the Govern--

ment of the Church, or in a mo-

naftic Life, I would prefer the for-

mer a thoufand Degrees before the

the latter. Nor have I been want-

ing, at arty Time, to give thofe their
jiift Praifes who difcharge that Of-

fice well ; nor can any one reafon-

ably fuppofe, that, were I fufficient

for it, I would {hurt what I myfelf

fo highly applaud. But what can I
do ? I, who am fubjedl to this In-

adivity and Slothfulnefs of Spirit,

than

than which, nothing renders a Man
more unfit for this facred Miniftration^ though, indeed, fom look upon it as Aufterity in me, and the
Effeds of an admirable Difcipline whereas it rather ferves as a fort of
Veil, to hide my many Infirmities,
For he that is ufed to enjoy fo great a Freedom, and to lead an inadive Life, though he be naturally of a
Genius fit for Bufinefs, yet, when AAion is required of him, his utter Unfkilfulnefs therein will much
perplex him, and his Inadivity will
be no fmall Impediment to his na--

tyral Abilities. But when, to this
Inadivity of Life there is alfo joined a Slownefs of Underftanding (which
I take to be, in a good meafure, my
own Cafe), fuch a one\ if he under-
takes this high Adminiftration, will

Statue. For this is the Caufe that
fo very few, who have been ad-
vanced from the monaflic Order,
make any Figure in the Church, when they come to be Bifhops ; but
the greater Part of them fall into Reproach and Infirmity, and are forced to undergo many things that
are grievous and unpleafing. And

that with good Reafon : For when

Way the

of Life is fo very different,

he that is ever fo well exercifed in the one differs nothing from one
utterly unfkilled, when he comes to

the other.
He that enters into this Lift,

ought efpecially to defpife Glory,

to be fuperior to Anger, and to

be endued with great Difcretiono

Whereas he that affeds a monaftic
m Life, is not Hable to be exercifed

any of thefe Refpeds. For as, on

the

^^6 St. Chu YsosTOM
the one hand, he hath few Provo-
cations to put him upon the Study of Patience, fo, on the other, he
hath no Sycophants and Admirers, whofe Praifes he fhould learn to reject ; and as for that Prudence which is requifite in Church AfFairs, he is quite a Stranger to it.
When this fort of Men, there-
fore, come to be exercifed with the
Pradice of thofe things, to the Study of which they have never appUed themfelves, they are wholly at a
Lofs, not knowing which Way to
turn themfelves, nor what to do; and, confequently, inftead of making 1 Proficiency in Virtue, lofe thofe Ex-
cellences they brought with them*

Drofs in Metals, fo this Teft of the

Men : If a Man be wrathful, mean-

fpirited, ambitious, arrogant, or fub-^

jed: to any other Diftemper of Mind,

it difcovers thofe Diftempers ; and

not only difcovers them, but often

renders them more ftubborn and ob-

jftinate than they v/ere before. For

as bodily Wounds, when fretted, are

thereby rendered much more diffi-^

cult to be healed ; fo the Difeafes of the Soul, being ftirred and exalpe-

rated, become naturally more fierce,

and precipitate thofe that are afted

GfSces, the Evil One will find
many Opportunities of Advantage,
unlefs he put the ftrideft Guard imaginable upon himfelf. For the
Eye of a beautiful Woman, w^hether

warmly upon the Soul, and puts it
into much Diforder. Smooth Flat-
teries foften it, and Honours enilave
it : And fo, fervent Charity (the
Bond of all Virtues) may become ac-
cidentally the Caufe of infinite Evils. Moreover, incefiTant Cares blunt the

to be exempted from Cares and

me, perfedly knows them all, what
Advantage would it be to me to conceal them from Men ? Know,

after he hath had a clear View of all thefe things, bid him mount on Horfeback, and take upon him the

Truth; nor fappofe, that becaufe

not fee any thing of the inviUble

World,

of the Priesthood; 373 World, that, therefore, I make the
thing greater than it really is. For,
undoubtedly, could you difcern the Legions of the Prince of Darknefs, and the furious Onfets of the Devil,
you would fee a Warfare much

greater, and more terrible, than that
which I have now reprefented. It

is true, indeed, you there have not

Arms

of Brafs and Iron ;

you have

not Horfes, and Chariots, and

Wheels ;

you have not Fire and

Darts, nor other vilible Inftruments

of War : But you have other fort

of Weapons, of a much more dread-

ful Nature. Thefe Adverfaries need

not Breaft-plates, Shields, Swords,
or Spears: Noj the very Sight of

that curfed Hoft is of itfelf enough

to diffolve the Soul, unlefs it be very
valiant indeed; and unlefs its own

both the one and the other, as there is between the Soul and Body. For,
in this fpiritual Warfare, when a Soul is wounded, and falls, it doth not
lie like a dead Corple, bereaved of
Senfe, but it is, from that Time,

tormented by the Remorfe of an

evil Confcience; and, after its De-

parture out of this Life, it is, at the
Time of its Judgment, delivered

over to eternal Punifhment.

Moreover, if the Soul of any Sin-

ner is infeniible, and feels not the
Wounds which it receives from the Devil, fo much the worfe, and more

dangerous its Cafe : For he that feels
not the firft Wound, will eafily re-
ceive a fecond, and a third. And

when that impure Spirit finds a Soul

that is fupine and carelefs of its for-

mer Wounds, he ceafes not, till the

the Wars of mortal Men with one

dreadful Labour, and many other
things, give a Refpite to the Soldier,
that he may put off his Armour,
and breathe a little, and refrefh himiAi with Meat -and Drink, thereby

I mean, that \4elires to remairl al-

of tbofe two things will neceflarily

happen ; either tha,t, being 4iiarmedj he fall before the Enemy, and be

loft ; or elfe that he continue lying

on bis Arms, and be conftantly on

I^or this is w:hat the Adverfary doth

/u^aftly, there is a great Pi^rencQ

alfo in another RefpecS:, which, to,

thofe that are not conftantly upon

he affails us by Surprize, and un-
awares.

And could you now have defired that I fhould have taken upon me to
lead forth the Spldiers of Chrift ? or,
had I done fo, would it not rather have been to lead them for the Service of the Devil? For if he, whofc

Office it is to fet in prder arid xn^
ftrud others, is altogether weak and

unfkilful himfclf, and fo, through

his Incapacity, thofe committed to
his Charge be betrayed to their own

Ruin, fuch a Leader conducts his
Men rather to the Devil, than to

Chrift.
But, what do you figh for ? Why
do you weep ? For I think, after
this Reprelentation, my prefent
State appears much more to be re-

joiced at and congratulated, than

lamented and deplored.
