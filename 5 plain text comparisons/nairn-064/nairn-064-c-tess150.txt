2 CHR YSOSTOMUS (Lt

ἀληθεῖς, καὶ τοὺς τῆς φιλίας νόμους καὶ εἰδότες καὶ φυλάτ-
rovtes ἀκριβῶς" εἷς δέ τις τουτωνὶ τῶν πολλῶν, ἅπαντας
αὐτοὺς ὑπερβαλλόμενος τῇ πρὸς ἡμᾶς φιλίᾳ, τοσοῦτον
ἐφιλονείκησεν ἀφεῖναι κατόπιν αὐτοὺς, ὅσον ἐκεῖνοι τοὺς

5 ἁπλῶς πρὸς ἡμᾶς διακειμένους.
μοι χρόνον παρηκολουθηκότων ἦν.

2. Οὗτος τῶν τὸν ἄπαντά
καὶ γὰρ μαθημάτων

ἡψάμεθα τῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ διδασκάλοις ἐχρησάμεθα τοῖς
αὐτοῖς" ἦν δὲ ἡμῖν καὶ προθυμία καὶ σπουδὴ περὶ τοὺς
λόγους, οὗς ἐπονούμεθα, μία, ἐπιθυμία τε ἴση καὶ ἐκ τῶν

10 αὐτῶν τικτομένη πραγμάτων.

οὐ γὰρ ὅτε εἰς διδασκάλους

μόνον ἐφοιτῶμεν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡνίκα ἐκεῖθεν ἐξελθόντας βου-
λεύεσθαι ἐχρῆν ὁποίαν ἑλέσθαι τοῦ βίου βέλτιον ἡμῖν ὁδὸν,
καὶ ἐνταῦθα ὁμογνωμονοῦντες ἐφαινόμεθα. 3. Καὶ ἕτερα δὲ

ἃ. ds] i.e. Basil (Βασίλειοε), not
mentioned by name until c. 4. ‘The
identity of this Basil has not yet
been definitely determined. It is,
however, certain that he was not
Basil the Great, of Caesarea in Cap-
padocia: see Jutroduction p. xxxiv.

3. τοσοῦτον κτλ.] ‘strove as hard
to leave them behind, i.e. to outstrip
them in the competition for Chry-
sostom’s friendship. For ἀφεῖναι.
κατόπιν cp, vi 12 πολλῷ τῷ μέτρῳ

κατόπιν ἀφεῖναι.
λῶρ .. διακ.] ‘who were
neutrally disposed towards me’:

that is, had no special affection.
. μαθημάτων Chrys. intended
to adopt the career of an advocate :
cp. τὸν δικαστηρίῳ προσεδρεύοντα

 

 

7. διδασκάλοιυ] Chrys. learnt
thetoric from Libanius, the famous
sophist: and philosophy from An-
dragathius (of whom nothing else
seems to be known): see Socrates
Ἢ, E. vi 3, and Sievers Leben des
Libanius p. 150. His teachers in

Christian doctrine were Meletius
(then Bishop of Antioch), Diodorus,
and Carterius: Soz. viii 2.

οὖς ἐπονούμεθα] For the use
of the middle, πονεῖσθαι, instead of
the active, cp. ii 1 τῷ περὶ ταῦτα
πονουμένῳ, and ν 5 τοῦ πονεῖσθαι
ἀπήλλακται (where it is used, as
here, of rhetorical exercises): also
Homm. in 2 Cor. 503 ὁ γεωργὸς
διέ ὅλου πονεῖται τοῦ ἔτου. The
accus. with πονεῖσθαι is more
common in verse.

13. καὶ ἕτερα δέ κτλ.] ‘And other
bonds besides these remained un-
broken and secure’: i.e. besides
having tastes in common, Chry-
sostom and Basil were well matched
in respect of (a) fatherland, (4)
wealth, and (c) position. ᾿Εφυλάτ-
ero, lit. ‘were preserved,’ indicates
that all these bonds of union re-
mained unchanged as they grew up.
The vulgate reading (see critical
note) gives an easier construction :
but it seems to be interpolated.
