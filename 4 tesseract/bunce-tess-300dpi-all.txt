MONG the many Friends
formerly had, who were

true and fincere; who

- both well underftood the

Laws of Friendfhip, and exaally ob-
ferved them ; ‘there was one. parti-

much as they did my common and
ordinary Acquaintance, |
This Friend was perpetually with

me; for,.as we were brought up in
the fame Studies, and under the
fame Mafters, {o our Inclinations, our
Applications and Defires, were the
fame. Nor did this’ Agreeablenefs
of Difpofition in us continue only
while we were Fellow-Students, but
afterwards, when we came out into
the World, and were to chufe what
Courfe of Life we would follow,
even then there ftill appeared the
fame Similitude of Difpofition, the:
fame Harmony and Union as be-

fore. r
Nor did it a little contribute to
render this Union of our Wills frm
and conftant, that there was no great
‘Difference between us in point of
worldly circumftances, and that
neither
of the PRipsT HOOD. 3
neither of ‘us had any’ Reafon to
overlook the other on the Account
of a large Eftate. For, as for my
own Patt, my Riches were far from
being-a Burden tome ; and as for
him, his Affairswere ata very low
Ebb: ~Neverthelefs, in this alfo we
were alike, that our Minds were
fuited to the Mediocrity of . our
Fortunes.  Befides, our Birth was
equally good ; fo that all things’
concurred to unite our Affections.

But as foon as we attained the
Age, when it was expected that we
fhould enter upon that happy State,
a monaftic Life, and apply ourfelves
to the Study-of true Philofophy, the
Balance of our Inclinations hung no
longer in an equal Poife, but my
Friend's ‘Scale, ‘being “free from all
Incumbrances, mounted upwards,
whereas mine, being oppreffed: with

worldly Defires and! youthful Ima-
ginations, funk downwards with the
_ Weight.

Our Friendfhip, however, con~
tinued firm as before, only we did’
not converfe fo frequently: | For,
indeéd,. it was not proper for thofe
Perfons.to ccrrefpond familiarly to-
gether, who were attached to Stu-
dies of fo different a Nature. ~ But,
when once I began : to exalt. my
Head«a little above the. Waves - of:
this World, and thought of difen-
gaping myfelf from fecular- Con-
cerns, he received me with open
Arms: But neither fo could we
maintain our former Equality ; | for
he had. gained much Advantage over
me, on two Accounts, having given
himfelf up to the Studies of heavenly |
Wifdom much fooner than myfelf,

and that too with a much more
eager

eager Prpboarany, and ray De-
fires; ie

But, though the! had thus the Start
of. me,’ yet fuch was his Goodnefs,
and fo.true a. Value had he for my
- Friendthip, : that, withdrawing him-
felf from the. Converfation of his
other Friends, he gave up his Time
wholly to me: Still profecuting his
former Defign of perfuading me to
retire from the World, which, as I
faid before, he had not been able,
as yet, to effet, through the In-
dolence and Indifpofition of my
Temper. Nor, indeed, was it pof-
fible for me, who was a conftantly
engaged at the Bar, at the Theatre,
and other public Diverfions, to have
‘much of his Converfation, who lived
always at home, and was wholly
engrofied by his Books. Having
ech thus hindered hitherto, he had

B 3 ne
6 St. CHRYSCSTOM
no fooner an Opportunity to renew
his Solicitations of my. entering into
the fame Method of Life with him-
felf, than he gave Birth:to that De-
fire which had been, fo long con-
ceived in his Mind. For he never
left me, no, not a Minute in a Day,
but kept conftantly. plying me with
moft prefling Arguments, that, for-
faking our Houfes, we fhould. retire
. together to fome fequeftered Place.
In fhort, he prevailed upon me:
And nothing now. remained, but
to execute our Defign. The only
thing which was likely to hinder
me from gratifying my Friend, or
rather myfelf, in this Affair, was the
-repeated Inftances of my. Mother ;
who no fooner perceived my Inten-
tion, than, taking me by the Hand,
fhe led me‘into her Chamber: And,

HIS, and much more, did
- my Mother remonftrate to
me: Which when I related to my
generous Friend, he was fo far from
being moved. therewith, that he re-
renewed his former Sollicitations, and
made more prefling Inftances than
before. ,
While Matters were thus circum-
flanced, he continually intreating
me and I as conftantly refufing, on
a fudden there was a Report {pread,
which gave us no {mall Uneafinefs;
namely, that we were both of. us
defigned,. ere long, to be promoted
to the Dignity of the Epifcopal

oe
When
of the PrinstHoop, x6

When. I firft heard this, I was
ftruck with Fear and Surprize :
With Fear, left I fhould be dragged
to the EleGion againft my Will :
and with Surprize, that the Se
fhould think of us for this, facred
Office: Efpecially, when I confi-
dered myfelf, and could not find
that I had any thing in me worthy
of this Honour.

On the fpreading 7 this Ru-
mour, my Friend direétly came to
me ;.and, taking me afide as one
unacquainted with the Matter, told
me all that he had heard; and
begged of me, that we might not
follow different Counfels, but that
our Refolutions and Proceedings
might appear to be uniform in this
Affair, as they had hitherto been in
-others:_ That, for his own Part, he

was ready to follow my Example,
which
16 St. CurysostTom

which way foever I fhould think
beft to difpofe of myfelf, whether
to fly from the Election, or to fub-
miit to it.

_ Perceiving, therefore, his Readi-
nefs, and thinking that I fhould be
very injurious to the Church, if, for
the fake of my own Inability, I
fhould defraud the Flock of Chrift
of fo excellent a Perfon, who was,
in all Refpedts, fo fit to prefide over
it; I thought it not proper to de-
clare my Mind in this Matter, but
fuffered myfelf- to do what I had
never done before, viz. to conceal
my own Sentiments from my Friend:
Telling him, therefore, that I would
cbt dey of this fome other Time
(for that the thing would not be
‘urged upon us inftantly); and that,
whenever it was, he need not doubt

but we fhould be unanimous, and.
: take
ofthe PrissTHOOB, 14

take the fame Steps, I perfuaded
him, for the prefent, to think no
more of the Matter.

Not long after, when the Time
was at hand that we fhould be or-
dained, I hid myfelf.’ He knowing
nothing of it, was taken, and led
to the Bifhop’s, as upon fome other
Account, where he received the
Yoke of Chrift: Not doubting, from
what-I had promifed, but that I
would certainly follow his Example 5
_orrather thinking, that in this he fol-
lowed mine. For fome that were pre-
fent feeing him angry, and ill-pleafed
at his being thus furprized, deceived
him, by faying, how abfurd a thing
it was, that I, who in all Mens
Eyes feemed the moft untraétable of
the two, fhould fo quietiy refign
myfelf to the Judgment of the Bi-

in ; but that he, who was always
C known
18 St.CHrRysosTom

known to excell in Prudence and
Good-nature, fhould, upon this Oc-
cafion, behave himfelf in a fierce and
haughty Manner, flying back, con-
tradi€ting, and refufing to comply.
This had its Effe@, and he fub-:
mitted. Abo

But when he underftood that I
had fled, and concealed myfelf, he
refted not till he had found :me
out; and, fitting down by me, with
Shame and Sorrow in his Looks, he
feemed paflionately eager to have
{poken ; ; but the inward Oppretlion
and Anxiety which he laboured un-
der {topped his Speech. The Vehe-
mence of his Concern choaked his
Words to fuch a Degree, that, when _
he opened his Lips, he had no Power
to utter himfelf, through the violent
Perplexity and Perturbation of his
Mind. Seeing him thus full of Tears

and
ofthe PRIESTHOOD, 1g

and Trouble, and well knowing from
what Caufe all this Concern pro-
ceeded, I could not contain that Ex-
cefs of Pleafure which I felt within
myfelf, but burft out into a loud
Laughter ; and, catching him faft by
his ‘right Hand, I conftrained him to’
kifs me; at the fame Time glorifying
God, that he had crowned my Con-
trivance with all that Succefs which
Thad fo much defired it might have.
But when he faw me thus joyful and
pleafant, and perceived thereby that
I had plainly deceived him in this
Matter, he changed Colour, and was
very angry.

OWEVER, recovering him-

felf a little from thofe Dil-
orders; Although (faith he) you have
C2 no
20 oT. CHRYSOSTOM

no Regard for me, nor any Value.

for my Credit (for what Reafon, I
cannot imagine), yet, methinks, you
fhould take more Care of your own
Reputation. For, to be plain with
you, your late Behaviour hath
opened all Mens Mouths againtt
you, who fcruple not to fay, that
you fled from this facred Office only
out of a proud and vain-glorious
Humour: Nor have I met with one
Man that fo much as attempts to
clear you of this Charge. For my
own Part, I cannot walk the Streets,
but I am prefently attacked on all
Sides, and blamed on your Ac-.
count cvery Day. My own Friends,
where-ever they meet, me, accufe
me with being acceflory to your
Mifmanagement, and a great Part
of your Cane icatnie ica falls on me,
For, - fay they, you. could not ‘be
ignorant
of the PrizstTHoop, 21

‘ignorant of his Intentions, it being
‘notorious that he always opened bis
Heart to you: And, therefore, you
ought not thus to have diffembled
the Matter with us, but to have ac-
guainted us with his Defigns, which,
‘if you had done, we fhould, no doubt,
have circumvented him, by fome
Stratagem or other. Now, what
Reply could I make to this? To
confefs that I was a Stranger to your
‘Defigns, was to reprefent our Friend-
fhip as a mere Piece of Hypocrify ;
which I was afhamed to do. For
although fo it is, as now too plainly
appears from your late Behaviour,
and as you yourfelf cannot deny ;
yet I thought, that whatever Faults
there might be between us, it would
be much more for our Credit to hide
them, than to expofe them to the
World, efpecially to thofe who are

C3 but
22 Sr. CHRYSOSTOM

but indifferently aftected towards us.
Unwilling, therefore, to own the
Truth, and to let them know how
Maton ftand between us, I am
forced to hold my Tongue, to caft
down my Eyes with Confufion, and
to fhun, when I am able, the meet-
ing with my Acquaintance, Nay,
fhould I, by owning the Truth, en-
deavour to excufe myfelf from the
Crime of being acceflory to your
Mifmanagement ; yet this would be
a vain Attempt, it would be what
they would look upon as mere Fic-
tion, and nothing elfe. For it is
impoffible ever to make them be-
lieve, that Baf/ was one of thofe
from whom you concealed any of
your Intentions: Though, as to the
thing itfelf, fince I perceive it is
a’ Pleafure to you that fo it fhould
be, Iam content, and {hall not dif-

pute
of the PRIESTHOOD, 23

pute the Matter with you. But this
is not all: There are large Portions
of Shame yet behind, which we muft
be loaded with. Some accufe you
of Infolence, others, of Vain-glory :
But they who are moft fevere in
their Cenfures, lay them both to
our Charge, and augment the whole
by that great Indignity and Affront
which (fay they) we have offered to
thofe who have ‘vouchfafed thus to
honour us; adding, moreover, that
the Difgrace they have fuffered from
us, had it been much greater, was
but what they juftly deferved, who
could ‘pafs by fo many Perfons of
fuch. Excellence and Worth, and
chufe a couple of raw Youths, who
were but of Yefterday, and who had
not yet difengaged themfelves from
worldly Cares (however, for the pre-
fent, they contracted the Brow, put

C 4 on
24 Sr. CurysosTrom
on Black, and diffembled a Gravity
of Perfon.and Behaviour), and pro-
mote them, at once, to fuch an
eminent Dignity, as they themfelves
could never have had the Vanity to
afpire to; no, not fo much as in a
Dream: And thus, fay they, Men
of Years and Gravity, who, frem
their Youth up, have exercifed them--
felves in all the Study and Hardthips
of Religion, are ftill in the Place of
Tnferiors; while they, who have the
Rule over them, are mere Boys, that
nave no Regard to thofe Laws by
which their Adminiftre ation is to be
regulate d. “i
This, and’a great deal more, is,
oy one or other, every Day objected
againft us: ‘Fo all which, “I am at

that your Flight was an inconfiderate
Adtion, or that you would rafhly,
and without Caufe, have incurred
the Difpleafure of fo many venerable
-Perfons: And,.as I do believe, that
what you did was the Effect of much
‘Thought and Premeditation, fo, I
affure myfelf, that your Reafons for
it are {trong and conclufive.

Tell me, therefore, what is it that
we can offer in our juft Vindication
again{t thofe who thus accufe us?
For, as for my own private Injuries,
how I have been deluded and tre-
panned by you, without the leaft
Regard had to our former Friend-
fhip, I call you to no Account for
them. Though it muft by no means
be diffembled, that whereas I, with
all the Opennefs imaginable, did, in
a manner, put my very Soul into
your Hands; you, on the contrary,

: behaved
26 Srw~CHRYSOSTOM

behaved towards me with all the
Subtlety and underhand Dealing that
one Enemy couid have ufed towards
another. If you knew the Counfel
which I followed to be good and
ufeful, you yourfelf, one would
think, fhould not have fhunned the
Advantage of it; and, if you knew
it to be hurtful and pernicious, furely
you ought not to have fuftered that
Friend, who. was fuperior to all
others in your Affection, to have
fallen into it. Yet this: you did,
and in this you was the chief Inftru-
ment: Though, to fay the Truth,
there was little Occafion to ufe fo
much Artifice and Craft towards
one who always fpoke and adted
fincerely, and without Difguile.

However, as I faid before, I do
not now ¢all you to an Account for
thefe things; neither do I reproach
3 you
of the PRIESTHOOD. 27

you with that folitary State into
which you have thrown me, by
putting an End to. thofe friendly
Meetings and Converfations, from
which I ufed to receive. fuch
Pleafure and Advantage. All thefe
things I pafs over lightly, and with
Silence ; not becaufe your Offence
againft me is flight in itfelf, but be-
caufe this was the Rule which I
fixed to myfelt, from the very firft
Moment that I courted your Friend-
fhip, that, however at any Time you
fhould grieve me by any Unkind-
nefs, I would never bring you under
a Neceflity of apologizing for your-
felf; though, moft certainly, the In-
jury you have done me is by no
means a trifling one, as you your-
felf know; efpecially, if you call to
mind how I am, at once, deprived
of all that Felicity which we both
promifed
28 St. Curvsostom

promifed ourfelves in this our Friend-
{hip, and which others ufed to pre-
fage, concerning it. We promifed
ourfelves, that our mutual Love
would be a mutual Advantage and
Safety to us; and others faid, that
at would be no. Iefs ufeful to the
‘World. .Now, though I had no
Thoughts that our Union would be
of much Ufe to others, yet I flat-
tered myfelf, that it would be of fin-
gular Advantage to ourfelves, fince
it would render us more inacceflible
and firm againft the Attempts of
our Enemies: And this, you may
remember, was an Argument which
I frequently inculcated to you.

I bid you confider, that the Times
were difficult, and the Adverfaries
many: That true Charity was, in a
manner, extin@; and Envy, that
Plague of Mankind, had fucceeded

nH in
of the PRIESTHOOD. 29

in its Place... My Friend, faid 1,
we pafs through the midft of Snares,
and walk, as it were, on the Battle-
ments of a,Tower: If we makea
falfe Step, or if any thing amifs be-
falls us, there are enough ready, in
all Places, to rejoice and infult at
it: But. where are there any that
will lay our Sufferings to heart, or
compaflionate our Calamities? Take
heed, therefore, faid J, left, by any”
unhappy Means, this our Friendfhip
be diffolved, atl we become a Jeft,
and a Derifion, to the World, nay,
bring on ourfelves fuch real Evils, as
are much worfe than all the Con-
tempt that can be poured upon
us. Remember the Words of the
Wife Man, 4 Brother holpen by a
Brother, is as a fortified City, and
as a Kingdom firengthened with Bars
and Gates. Let us be careful, there-
fore,
zo St.CHrysostom:

fore, that this our Amity be not dif
folved, nor the Bands of our Friend-
fhip broken afunder.
! ‘This, and much more to the famé
Purpofe, did T often repeat to you:
Nor had'I the leaft Sufpicion that
your Affe&tions towards me were at
all tainted; but, out of the Abun-
dance of my Love, I offered good
Advice, where I had no Reafon to
think it was at all wanted: Nor was
I in the leaft aware, that, in thus
counfelling you, I adminiftred Phy-
fic to a fick Perfon: Though (un-
happy that I am) not any thing that
I ‘could offer hath been fuccefsful,
nor could all my Precaution be of
any Service to me. So far from that,
that, cafling away from you, at once,
all my Admonitions, and never fuf+
fering them fo much as to enter into
your Mind, you have driven me out,
as

as a Ship without Ballaft, into the
wide Ocean, without any Concern
how I fhall there fuftain the Incle-
mency: of thofe Waves, which will,
on all Sides, beat fo furioufly upon
me.

' For if, at any Time, J fall into an
unhappy Neceflity of ‘fuffering Ca-
lumny, or Derifion, or any other
Injury or Moleftation, (as it is very
fure fuch things as thefe will often
befall me), to whom fhall I now
have Recourfe? To whom fhall I
communicate my Grieis? Who is:
there that will be ready to help me,
to repel] and keep off my Enemies,
to comfort me in the midft of my
Trouble, and to prepare my Mind,
by wife Counfels, to bear with Pa-
tience the Follies of others? There
is not fo much as one to whom I .
can apply for Affiftance, in thefe

Difh-
e2 St. CurysostTom

Difficulties, now fince have with-

in the firft Place, the SatisfaGion of
fuch a Friend; the Negligence which
I thould, in’ this Matter, be guilty
of towards him; would be oreater
than that Love and Care which he
hath exprefied towards me.

_ Since, therefore, from hence Tam
to begin my Apology, give me Leave
to afk this Queftion, In what: have

ceived you, and concealed my own
Defigns from you? But in this I
{erved two good Purpofes at once,
by confulting the Good of my Friend,
and the Benent of thofe to whom I
betrayed him.

If

If you object, that, neverthelefs,

I betrayed you; that I freely own:
And, if it be true, that all fort of
Deéeit is finful, and that it may in
no Cafe be made ufe. of, not even
for public Good and Benefit, I will
be content to fufter whatever Punifh-
ment you pleafe: Or rather, becaufe
I know the Tendernefs of your Na-
ture towards me, I would pais the
fame Sentence of Condemnation on
myfelf, as the Judges would in
open Court on a Perfon convicted
of fraudulent PraGices. But if the
thing itfelf be not always hurtful,
but sae or bad, according to the
Ini@iitions of him that makes ufe of
it, ceafe then to blame i that I
have deceived you, or elfe prove,
that I have done it oe an ill De-
fion. For, indeed, if that be want-
ing, if there be no evil Mind or

36 Srv Curysostom
wicked Purpofe, the Deceiver is, in
the Opinion of all fair Judges, fo far
from Blame, that he deferves Com-
mendation and Applaufe: And fo
confiderable is the Advantage of a
well-timed Deceit, done with a right
Purpofe, and a good Defign, that
many ‘have been Sufferers for ne-
glecting to ufe it.

Nay, if you look back on the fa-
mous Generals that have flourifhed,
from the Beginning of the World
to this Time, I am well affured,
that you will find the greater Part of
their fuccefsful Actions to have been
chiefly owing to Stratagem and De-
ceit ; and the wife Contrivers of them
“have met with more Applaufe than
thofe who, by mere Dint of Arms,
have vanquifhed their Enemies in
‘the open Field: For thefe obtain
their Victories at fuch a prodigious

‘Expence,
of the PRIESTHOOD. gn

Expence, both of Men and Money,
that they are, on the whole, but of
imall Advantage to them; and the
Victors are in little better Condition
than the Vanquifhed, having their
Forces greatly diminifhed, and their
Treafure no lefs exhaufted. Neither,
indeed, have they the fole Glory of
the Action: No inconfiderable Part
of it redounds to them, whofe Cou-
rage was not conquered, though
their Bodies were, and wha, if they
could have fought without falling in
the Field, would ftill have continued
to have given Proofs of an undaunted
Valour: Whereas he that gains a
Victory by Stratagem and Conduét,
expofes his Enemy, at once, to De-
{truction and Derifion. For though,
where a Battle is gained by mere
Strength, the Vanquifhed have their
Share of Glory as well as the Victors,
| D 3 yet
38 St. Curysostom

yet it is quite otherwife where a
Victory 4 is obtained by Policy alone:
For, in that Cafe, the Glory of the
Adtion refts entirely on his Side who
conquers 3 befides that he carries
home with him a moft perfec& and
unmixed Pleafure for a Victory ob-
tained without Lofs of Blood.

For, in warlike Attempts, it is
not with the Wifdom of the Mind,
as it is with Riches or Numbers of
Men: Thefe, the more they are
made ufe ef, the more they are di-
minifhed: Whereas, on the con-
trary, this, the oftener you have Re-~
courfe to it, the more it brightens,
and increafes on your Hands:

Nor is this Sort of Deceit ufeful
only in War, and in public Affairs ;
but in Peace alfo, and in one’s own
private Concerns, it is often of great

Advantage, and that too Antone

the neareft Relations. The Hufband
often finds it neceffary towards his
Wife, and the Wife towards her
Hudband ; the Father towards his
Son; .one Friend towards another ;
nay, even Children, fometimes, to-
wards their Parents. Thus, Saul’s -
Daughter * could by no other means
deliver her Hufband out of her Fa-
ther’s Hands, than by Fraud and Cir-
cumvention: And, in like Manner, at
another Time her Brother + defiring
to preferve the fame Perfon fafe Stew

poled, had Recourfe to the like Arts

beft of Men! and, for this
Reafon, I prevented you, by faying
before, that it was lawful to ufe
Deceit, not only in War, and againft
an Enemy, but in Peace alfo, and

cowards one’s Friends.

Nay, this very thing is, in fome
Cafes, ufeful not only to the De-
ceiver, but to the Deceived. If you
a the Truth of this, go but ‘to

Phyfician, and afk him in what

Man.
of the PRIESTHOOD. 44

Manner he fometimes cures his Pa-
tients; and he will tell you, that
his Art is not always of itfelf fuf-
ficient, but he is often obliged to
mix Deceit with his Medicines. For
_ when the Cafe is fuch, that, either
by the Untraétablenefs of the Pa-
tient, or the Obftinacy of his Dif-
temper, the Prefcriptions of the
Phyfician can have no Effect, there
he muft, of Neceflity, have Recourfe
to Artifice and Contrivance, and act
his Part, as Players do on the Stage,
under a Difeuife : And here, if
you pleafe, I will give you a merry
Inftance of one of thofe many Arti-
fices which I have heard practifed
by thofe Sons of Art.

It happened that a certain Man
fell ill of a Fever, which raged very
violently, and without Intermiffion.
The fick Perfon loathed all things

that
42 St. Curysostom

that were proper to abate his Dif-
temper, but had a longing Defire
for'a good Draught of Wine, and
begged earneftly of every one that
came into the Room, to gratify this
his pernicious Appetite ; which, had
it been done, would have inflamed
his Fever to fuch a Degree, as would
have made the poor Fellow quite
diftracted. - Here, therefore, where
there was no Room for Skill to exert
itfelf, they were forced to have Re-
courfe to Fraud and Contrivance,
by the Help of which, the Phyfician
effected what he could not compafs
by his Art: For, getting an earthen
Pan, juft come hot out of the Fur-
nace, he dipped it all over in Wine ;
and ordering the Room to be dark-
ened, that the fick Man might not
difeover the Deceit, he poured out
the Wine, filled it with Water, and

gave
of the PRIESTHOOD. 43

gave it to his Patient to drink,
The fick Man, deceived by the
ftrong Smell of the Wine into which
the Pan had been dipped, {layed not
curioufly to examine what it was
which the Doétor gave him, but,
being perfuaded by his Noftrils, that
it really was what he imagined, and
being hindered, by the Want of
Light, from difcovering the Cheat,
and being alfo eagerly defirous to
quench his Thirft, he drank it off |
with the utmoft Greedinefs. Upon
which his exceflive Thirft was al-
layed, his Fever abated, and the
Man recovered. So great are the
Power and Advantage of Deceit,
which as you have already feen in
this one Example, fo it were end-
lefs to produce Inftances of the like
Nature.

Nor
44 St. CHRysostom

Nor are thefe Frauds in ufe only
among Phyficians of the Body ;_ but,
if you examine the Matter never {o
little, you will find them practifed
by thofe alfo that have the Cure of
Souls.

Thus the bleffed ApoftleSt. Pax/*,
by holy Artifice, allured thofe many
thoufands of Jews which believed.
Thus alfo he, who circumcifed Z:-
mothy +, threatens the Galatians t,
that if they were circumcifed, Chrift
fhould profit them nothing: And
he || who counted the Righteoufnefs
which was by the Law as Lofs
after his Reception of the Faith
in Chrift, did, neverthelefs, maay
‘Times, and in many Cafes, fubmit
to the Law.

And truly great’ is the Power of
- Deceit, provided it be not done with
a treacherous Mind: Though, in-
deed, it ought not then to be termed
Deceit, but’ Management rather,
and Wifdom, and good Contri-
vance, by which Men work: them-
felves out of the greateft Difficul-
ties, and correct and amend the
Errors of the Mind.

For neither can'I call Phineas * a
Murderer, though, with one Stroke,
he flew two Perfons: No, nor £/-
jab +, though he caufed the Death of
an hundred Soldiers, and their Cap-
tains, and was the Author of that
Torrent of Blood which flowed -
at the Slaughter of Baal’s Priefts f.

the Will and Defign of the A&ors,
how can we excufe Abraham * from

Vindication of two of his Defcend-
ants, Facob and Mofes; the former
of which fupplanted his Brother of
the Rights of Primogeniture +; and
the latter enriched the [/raelites with
the Spoils of the Egyptians t ?

But, far be from us the Auda-
eioufnefs to pronounce fo. hardly of
thofe holy Men, whom we not only
free from ail Blame in thefe Matters,
but we reverence and admire them
for the fame, for which we alfo find
them praifed and commended by

ed of him, who enters into the very
Secrets of the Heart); but, without
Doubt, to teach us, that the due
Care and Matiagément of his Flock
was a'thing of the higheft Concer
to him. From whence it follows,
that great. and; unfpeakable will be
their Reward, who labour diligently
for the Welfare of thofe ‘things
which ate, of all others, moft dear
to Chrift. This we’may learn from

the Flock ; or, if he fuffers Punifh-

ent for it, that Punifhment, per-
haps, may only affect his Purfe, and
reach no farther than a pecuniary
‘Fine: But he that hath Mens
Souls, the rational Flock of Chrift,
entrufted to his Care, muft be an-
{werable for the Lofs of any of
them; not at the Expence of a Sum
of Money, but at the Peril of his
own Soul: Befides, that he hath a
much more difficult Tafk, to watch
and ftruggle for their Prefervation,
than he that hath the Care of na-
tural Sheep. For, truly, he hath
not to deal with Wolves or Thieves,
nor is he concerned how to keep off
the Rot from his Flock. What
then is his Warfare? and what Ene-
mies hath he to encounter? St. Pau/
will tell you*, We wreftle not againft

Ficfh and Blood, but againft Prin-
cipalities, againft Powers, againft the
Rulers of the Darkne/s of this World,
againft fpiritual Wickednefs in high
Places. You fee here, what a Mul-
titude of Enemies we have to deal
with, what deep-ranked and fierce
Troops, fufficiently armed at all
Points, not by Art, but Nature.
Would you fee another Army,
which flands ready to invade the
Flock of Chrift, without Mercy or
Compaflion ? This alfo the fame
View will {how you: For he who
{poke to us of the above-mentioned
Adverfaries, hath, in like manner,
defcribed thefe to us,’ in the follow-
ing Words; The Works of the Flefh
are manifeft, which are thefe; Adul-
tery, Lornication,’ Uncleanne/s, Laf-
civioufnefi, Idolatry, Witchcraft,
Hatred, Variance, Ezmulations,
Wrath,
of the PRIESTHOOD. 59
Wrath, Strife, Backbitings, Whif-
perings, Swellings, Tumults*, with
many more: For, indeed, he hath
not reckoned them all up; but, by
thofe which he hath here mentioned,
he gives us to underftand what Sort

of Enemies the reft are.

Befides, the Enemies of the
Flock, when they fee the Shepherd
flying from them, leave off their
Engagement with him, and are con-
tented with worrying and devouring
the Sheep. But the fpiritual Adver-
faries of Chrift’s Flock, though they
have gotten the Sheep into their
Power, are not fatisfied with de-
vouting them, but grow fo much
the more fierce and infolent, never
ceafing till they overcome the Shep-
herd, or are overcome by him.

Add to this, that the Difeafes of
Beafts are manifeft, whether it be
the Rot, . the. Murrain, an, acci-~
set Hurt, or any thing elfe

vhich pains and diforders the Crea-
ture; and the Appearance of the
Diftemper ‘renders it fo much the
more ealy to cure.

There is another thing a “ith
greatly contributes to their {peedy
Recovery 3 and that is, that the
Shepherd: hath full Power over his
Sheep, to make them fubmit. to
thofe Remedies which are proper
for them. If the Searing-iron or the
Incifion-knife is to be applied, he
can bind them faft for the Opera-
tion. If it be neceflary to change
their Food, or to hinder:them from
Drink, he can fhut them up, and
keep them confined as long as he
pleafes. In a Word, he can, very

eafily
of the PRIESTHOOD. 61
eafily, make them fubmit to all
Applications which he: thall judge
conducive to the Health and Sound-
nefs of his’ Flock.

But, with the fpiritual Difeafes of
ei Soul, it is quite otherwife. For,
in the fift Place, it is hard to dif-
cover them’: For the things of a2
Man, no Man knoweth, fave the
Spirit of - Man: which+is in bim.*.
And ‘how fhall’ any ‘ptelcribe to a

But how difficult foever -it be to

they are found ‘out:. .For the Cafe

Neither, indeed, doth God himéelf

Flock at Command; they follow
him wherefoever le leadeth them ;
and, if any of them turn afide out
of the right Way; or, if leaving
good Paftures, they-run to feed upon
barren and dangerous Cliffs, lie need

~Tean hardly think you ferious in
what you fay. I am fure, if you

now pretend to offer for my Con-
folation, are: fo far from anfwering
that End, that, on the contrary,
they convince me what juft Caufe I
have to mourn and lament my Con-
dition, with much Perplexity and
Trouble of Mind: In the farft Place,
becaufe I find that I have been de-
ceived and betrayed by you: But
abundantly more in the fecond |
Place; becaufe, from thofe very
Reafons which you have now oi-
fered for your own Vindication in
this Matter, 1 come to have a full
Knowledge and Apprehenfion of that
Depth of Misfortunes into which I
am plunged. For, if the true Rea-
fon of your withdrawing yourfelf
from
54 Sv. CurysostTom

from the Epifcopal Office was, be=
caufé you knew yourfelf incapable
and infufficient to bear the Weight
of fo facred a Fun@ion, how much
mire ought I to have been fet afide,
though I had ever fo earneftly de-
fired it; efpecially when, in this
Affair, I committed myfelf entirely
to your DireGtion; in which, it is
true, you confulted your own Wel-
fare, but negleéted mine: And, had
you only nestecced it, it had been
happy for me; but, as if that were
“nothing, you, by your ‘Artifices, was
the chief Inftrament of betraying
me into the Power of thofe who
Jay in wait for me.

And think not to efcape, by fay-
ing that you was led into an Error

For, in the farft Place, I muft
difclaim all Pretenfions to that:
And, in the next Place, however
that might be, the Truth ought
certainly to be preferred to common
Report. If, indeed, you yourfeif had
never had experimental Knowledge
of me in this Refpe&, you would
have had a fpecious Pretence to have
formed your Opinicn of my Cha-
raGer from common Fame: But,
fince my neareft Relations had not
a more intimate Acquaintance witl
me, nor knew my Heart half fo -
well as yourfelf, there is no Room
for any fuch Excufe; nor will it be
poflible for you to perfuade thofe
that hear you, but that my being
drawn into this dangerous Station,
was done defignedly, and on pur-
pofe, ‘by you.

76 Sr. Curysostonm

However, I will no farther infift
on this, being refolved (as I faid be-.
fore) not to oblige you to a Vindi-
cation of yourfelf on this Head.
Only tell me what Defence I fhall
make again{t thofe whofe Cenfures
fall heavy upon us both.

CHRYSOSTOM.

No; this muft by no means be:
For, though you fhould never fo
often excufe me from this Tafk,
yet I am refolved to ftand clear in
your Opinion, before I defcend to
clear myfelf to the reft of the
World.

You fay, that if, not knowing
you, I had breught you into the
State you are now in, my Ignorance
would have been my Excufe, and
taken from me all Blame in this
Matter: But, my doing this, when,
at the fame Time, I had a perfect

Know-

Knowledge of you, this, you fay, is
fo criminal a Part, that there is no
Room for me to make any juft
Apology for it.

Now, 1 muft declare, that, ‘in
this, I am entirely of another Mind.
If you afk me, Why? My Anfwer
is, That this is a Cafe which: re-
quires much Examination: And
whoever recommends another as a
Perfon fit for the facred Office,
ought by no means to fatisfy himfelf
with common Report concerning
{uch a one’s Sufficiency, but to make
particular Search and Enquiry into
the Abilities of. the Man.

For, when St. Paul *, {peaking
of fuch a one, faith, That Le muff
have a good Report from thenr which

Words exclude a more accurate

oy) Ti ie 7

Scrutiny and Probation; nor doth
he require this as the principal Sign
of that Perfon’s Fitnefs for fuch an
Office: But, having mentioned many
other Qualifications firft of all, he,
at laft, adds this alfo: Hereby fhow-
ing us, that, in fuch Elections, this,
of itfelf, is not enough, but . that,
together with the other Requifites,
this alfo fhould be included. For,
indeed, common Report may often
be miftaken, and ill-grounded; but
there is no Room to apprehend any
Danger from thence, if, befides this,
there is diligent Enquiry and due
Examination made: And for this
Caufe he mentions the Teftimonial
in the laft Place. Nor doth she only
fay, That he muft have a good Re-
port, but he adds, from them qwhich
are without, defigning hereby to

teach us, that the Life and Abili-
ties

rowly enquired into, before any Re-
gard is paid to the common Opinion

‘Since, "therefore, this was my

When fome difapproved of this your

thofe that blamed you for it, Wéat
feould I do? Or how can I better
foow, that I have learned the Duty
of Charity, than by haxarding my
own Life to refcue and preferve the
Life of my Friend?

Which Words are, indeed, dif-
ferent, but the Senfe is the fame
with what our Saviour faid to his

in Anfwer to this, I fay, firft,
That we ought not to fcruple the
affronting of Men, when we cannot
honour them, without being obliged
to affront God. - Nor, indeed, is it
fafe for the Perfons that are thus
offended, but of very dangerous
Confequence, to fuffer themfelves ta
be angry on fuch an Account. For
I think it becomes thofe that are
dedicated to God, and who have
their Eyes fixed on him alone, to
be fo pioufly difpofed, as not to
think it an Injury, theugh they

fhould (in this Manner) be difho-
noured* a thoufand Times. And
from hence, alfo, it is plain, that I
had not fo much as a Thought of
affronting thofe excellent Perfons.
And, truly, if an infoient Hu-
mour of Pride or Vain-glory had
been the Motive by which I. had
been influenced (according to thofe
Objections which, you fay, are fre-
quently made againft me), I might
juftly be looked upon as moft bafe
and injurious, in defpifing Men of
fuch admirable Virtue and high Sta-
tion, who, befides, had fo well de-
ferved at my Hands. For, if to
injure thofe that have done us no
| Wrong, is worthy of Punifhment ;
how highly ought we to honour and
efteem thofe, who, merely out of
their own Goodnefs and Benevo-

did this in Return for any good Of-
fices which I had at any Time done
them, in a greater or lefs Degree,
no one hath any Ground to, affirm,
And how great Punifhment doth he
deferve, that returns Evil for Good? _
But if nothing of this ever entered
into my Mind; but if I declined
that heavy Burden, the Priefthood,
on a quite different Confideration,
though they do not, perhaps, ap-
prove of what I have done, -yet, at
leaft, they might pardon it, and not
blame me for having Regard to my

this facred Office: For I will not

they not rather ie! thought me a
Fool, or-‘mad? And when the holy
Priefthood i is offered me, whichi is
as much higher than a Kingdom,
as the Spirit is more excellent than
the Fleth, will any one fay, that I
overlooked it through Difdain and
Contempt? I think I need not in-
fift on the Abfurdity of this, nor.
fhow how inconfiftent with good
Senfe it is, that they, who refufe Pre-
ferments of a lefs Degree, fhould
be cenfured as Madmen, while they,
who do the fame thing in Honours
of.a much more excellent Nature,
thould, neverthelels, be taxed, not
with

with Madnefs; but with Infolence
and Pride. ‘This is as if you fhould
fay, that he who refufes to be an
Herdfman, doth not do it becaufe
he thinks himfelf above that Com-
mand, but becaufe he is plainly
diftragted, and out of his Wits;
Whereas he that tefufes to be Mo-
narch of the whole World, or Cap-
tain-General of all the Armies in it,

fition, that it is poflible for Men to

they would not have been fo forward
to fufped, that I had fhunned it

And why hath no’ one ‘évér yet

the fame thing concerning the Dig-

caufe we shave high Thoughts and

OR, truly, the | Priefthood,
though it be adminiftered upon
Earth, is, neverthelefs, to be placed
in the Rank of heavenly Fundtions,
and that with the greateft Reafon:
Becaufe no mortal Man, no Angel,
er Archangel, or any other created
Power, but the Holy Ghoft himfelf,
hath eftablifhed this facred Order, |
and hath given Men Reafon to be-.
lieve, that, even whilft they are in
the Flefh, they perform the Mini-
{tration of Angels.. He, therefore,
that celebrates ‘the holy Myfteries,
ought

ought to be pure, as though he
were even now fianding in Hea-
ven, in the midft of thofe celeftial
Powers,

Venerable and tremendous were
the Mo/aic Inftitutions, before the
Times of Gtace; fuch as, the little
Bells, the Pomegranates, the Stones
on the Breaft-plate and on the
Ephod, the Mitre, the Bonnet, the
Robe, the golden Plate, the Holy
of Holies, and that awful Silence
which overfpread the facred Place *.

But, if we enquire into the Mini-
{trations under the Gofpel, we fhall
find thofe venerable and tremendous
Inftitutions to be as nothing, in.
comparifon of thefe: So true is that
which the holy Apdftle + hath aid

was made glorious had no Glory, in

For, when you fee our Lord fa.

when you fee the Prieft ftanding by’
‘the Sacrifice, and repeating over it
the Prayer of Confecration ; when
you fee the Communicants tinged

they fuch mean Adminiftrations, that

this, I will, by another Miracle,
farther fhow you-the Excellence of.
this facred Performance.

Imagine, then, that you fee
Elias * furrounded on.all Sides with
a vaft Multitude, the Sacrifice lying
ready on the twelve Stones, the
People obferving a profound Silence,
and the Prophet alone offering up
his Prayers; and, immediately after,
a Flame of Fire falling from Hea-

Thefe things are, indeed, om and
wonderful. —

- But now turn away your Byes,
and fix them on the Confecration of -
our facred Myfteries, where you will
not only fee things wonderful, but
things that furpafs all Admiration:
For here the Prieft ‘brings not Fire
from Heaven, but the Holy Spirit ;
and he offers a long Supplication,
not that a Torch let down from
above may confume the Gifts, lying
in open View; but that Grace,
defcending on the Sacrifice, may
thereby inflame the Souls of all that
are prefent, and make them brighter
than Silver purified j in the Fire. “And
is it ‘poflible that any one, except,
indeed, he be- out of his Senfes,
fhould defpife this moft tremendous
Myftery ? Or, are you ignorant that
the Soul of Man could never bear

But Chriftian Priefts have received

God hath given his Priefts a
greater Power, not only of punifh-
ing, but of doing Good, than he
hath given to our Parents by Na-

ire, between whom end his Priefts
there is as much Difference, as be-
tween this Life end that which is to
come. Our Parents begot us into
this prefent Life; but they beget us
into Life eternal. The former can-
not deliver us from the Death of the
Body, no, nor repell any approach-
ing Difeafe: But the latter have
often faved fick Souls, which were
going to Deftruction; and this not
by Doérine and Inftruction alone,
_ but allo by the Help of their Prayers.
For ee only when they regenerate
us by Baptifm, but afterwards too
they have a Power of remitting Sins.

No: But they are to be blamed
who abufe thofe Gifts.of God; and
all that are in their right Senfes will
certainly think them that do fo,
worthy not only of Blame, but of
Punifhment:

Nay; the Priefthood hath abun=
dantly more Reafon to expoftulate
warmly with us; who do {o ill per-
form its facred Functions. Nor, in-=
‘deed, is that holy Office to be acs
counted the Caufe of thofe Evils,
which I have already mentioned,
but we ourfelves, who have done

our Part too much to defile and
K 2 profane
132 Sr. Curysostom

profane it, by committing the Ad-
miniftration of it promifcuoufly to —
all Sorts of Men, who readily take
upon them that holy Fundion, never
confidering their own Abilities, or
having any Regard to the Weight
and Dignity of what they under-
take: And fo,.when they proceed
to the Execution of it, being loft
and bewildered in the Darknefs of
their own Ignorance, they become
the Caufe of infinite Misfortunes to
the People that are committed to
their Care. And, I affure you, this
very thing had like to have been
my own Cafe, if God, in great
Mercy to his Church, and to my
Soul, had not fpeedily refcued me
from fo imminent a Danger.

And here I would afk, From
whence, think you, do thofe mani-

fold Diforders arife, which we fo

frequently fee in the Church? I will
be bold to fay, that they flow from
no other Fountain than this, wiz.
that there is no due Care taken in
chufing proper Perfons to be Bifhops
and Governors of the Flock; but
People are put into that high Charge
lightly, and imconfiderately. The
Head, moft certainly, ought to be
found and good; how elfe fhall it
be able to difperfe thofe noxious Va-
pours, which afcend thither from
other Parts of the Body? If it can-
not do this, if that principal Part
be weak and infirm, and not of
Strength fufficient to repell thofe un--
wholefome Fumes, the Confequence
muft be, that the Head itfelf will
every Day grow weaker and worfe,
and, together with itfelf, deftroy
alfo the reft of the Body. | And that
there might not, at this Time, be

K%4 an
34 St. CHRYSOSTOM
an Inftance of this in me, it hath
pleafed, God to continue me in that
inferior Rank and Order, which he
at firtt. allotted me. .
For, indeed, mn Friend, there
are many other Ex xecllences, befides
thofe which have been already men-
tioned, which a Bifhap ought to be
endued with, and which I myfelf
am deftitute of; this efpecially, that
he ought to bac no Defire for that
high | Station: For. whoever afpires
to. this Dignity with Paffion and
Vehemence, will not {top there,
when he hath attained it, but his,
Ambition will j increafe with. his Pre~
ferment; and, being thus ftrongly
carried away with the. Violence
thereof, he will eps nothing,
though never fo vile and bafe, AO,.
nor large pecuniary Expences, to
eftablith himfelf. in’ the Honour he

hath

‘hath obtained. Nay, fo wrathfully
have fome Men contended for the
epifcopal Chair, that they have filled
the very Churches with Blood and
Slaughter, and the Cities with Ruin
and Defolation. But this I fhall not
now infift on, left what I fay fhould
feem to fome Perfons incredible, and
beyond Belief.

In the mean Time, I am per-
fuaded, that Men ought to have fo
profound a Reverence and Regard
for the Weight of this high Fundtion,
as to refufe it at firft, and draw back
from it; and if it happens that
they are elected to it afterwards,
and, after their Ele€@tion, are fo un-
happy as to fall into the Commif-
fion of any fuch Sin as deferves
Deprivation, they fhould not wait
for that Sentence from Men, but

voluntarily, and of their own
K 4 Accord,
136 St. Curysostom

Accord, diveft themfelves of that
Dignity... For thus may fuch an
Offender reafonably hope to obtain
Mercy at the Hand of God:
Whereas he that retains it beyond
what is meet, not only renders him-
felf unworthy of Pardon, but alfo
farther irritates the divine Difplea-
- fure, by adding to his firft Offence

a fecond af a more heinous Nature.
‘But fuch Conftancy of Mind is
very rarely, if ever, to be met with;
and, in Truth, to affeét and afpire
ambitioufly to this Honour, Is a
very peftilent and pernicious Dif
cafe: Nor doth this Affertion clafh
at all with the Dofrine of St. Paw/,
when he faith *, If a Man defire

Defire of this that I afhrm to be {@
dangerous,

CHAP. XI

“SHIS Defire, I fay, ought
. carefully to be rooted out of
the Soul; nor fhould. a Man fuffer
it to faften upon him at firft; that
fo he may be perfectly at Liberty ta
perform all the Duties of his Place
with Freedom and Boldnefs. For
he that is not ambitious of being
exalted to that Height of Power,
will no more be afraid of .being de-
pofed from it; and he that is free
from the Fear of that, will execute
all the Parts of his Office with fuch
a Liberty as becomes a Chriftian :
Whereas they that live under the

Fear and Dread of being turned out
of
738 Sr. Curysostom

of their Dignity, do really undergo
a' moft difagreeable Servitude, ‘at-
tended with many Evils,.and often
find themfelves under an unhappy
Neceflity of cftending both God and
Man,

The Soul, therefore, ought by
no means to. be thus afleCted: But
as we fee valiant Soldiers fight cou-
 tagioufly, and fall bravely in the

' Field of Battle; fo ought they that

undertake ‘this facred Adminiftra-
tion to. be-firmly refolved and pre-
pared, not only to perform the fe-
veral Parts of their Office, but to
quit it alfo, if Need be, as becomes
Chriftians ; remembering, that to
be depefed for doing: one’s Duty, is
ary honourable. Circumftance, and is
attended: with:a Reward in no-wife
inferior to the Dignity itfelf. And,
whenever any Perfon is.a Sufferer in

this Manner, and upon. this Account,
becaufe he will not fubmit to any
thing unbecoming and unworthy of
his epifcopal Character, he thereby
brings upon his Depofers a double
Punifhment ; but to himfelf he
procures a double Reward: For,
Bleffed are ye, faith our Lord *, when
Men foall revile you, and perfecute
you, and frall fay all manner of Evil
againft you, falfely, for my Sake.
Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for
great is your Reward im Heaven.
This Bleffing certainly belongs to
them that are deprived by their Col-
leoues, through Envy, or to gain
the Favour of others, upon fome
private Pique, or any other unjuft
Motive; for, as for thofe that are
Sufferers in this Manner from their
Enemies, I think there is no Need
| + Matt. v. its

to
140 Sr. CHRYSOSTOM

to fhow. what Gainers they are by
it, nor how greatly the Wickcdnets
of others contributes to their Ad-
vantage.

Upon the Whole, then, Men
ought to look well about them on
all Sides, and fearch diligently, that
no Spark of this ambitious Defire lie
fmothered up fecretly in the Soul :.
For it is an amiable thing, if even
thofe who, from the firft, try to
purge their Hearts from this Difeafe,.
fhall be able to avoid it, after they
are advanced to this Dignity: But
if any one, before he is thus ad-
vanced, nourifhes within his Breaft
this fierce and outrageous Beaft, it
is not poffible to fay into what a
Depth of Deftruétion fuch a one
precipitates himfelf, after he hath
obtained what he afpired to. Nor
may J conceal my own Weaknefs in

this
of the PRIESTHOOD, 141

this Refpe&; for, indeed, this Dif
temper of the Mind is what Iam too
muth afflicted with myfelf. And
think not that, by a pretended Mo-
defty, I would belye myéelf, to raife
your Opinion of me, when J affirm,
that I am too fubject to this perni-
cious Defire; and that this very
thing, among feveral others, terri-
fied me, and made me refolve to fly
from the epifcopal Order. For, as
in Cafes of perfonal Fondnels, the
nearer we are to thofe we love, fo
much the ftronger and more vehe-
ment our Paffion is; but when we
are at a Diftance, the Ardour of our —
Defire-abates, and grows cool by
Degrees ; juft thus it fares with
thofe that are fond of this facred
Dignity: Set them but near it, and
their Defires rage, and become 1n-
tolerable ; whereas, if once they find

them-
142 St. CHRysosToM

themfelves out of Hopes of it, theit
Expedtation, and their Defire, vanifli
together. This, therefore, is a good
Excufe for my Behaviour in nihil Af-
fair, and a fufficient Reafon, if I had
no other, to keep. me at a Diftance
from this honourable Office:

CHAP. XIh

faid, I will now lay before you
another thing, which is no lefs an
Impediment to.me in this Matter:
If. you afk, What that is? I-anfwer;
It is this; 4 Bifhop muft be fober;
and of good Behaviour; he muft.alfo
be vigilant *, and have his Eyes al-

not but confefs, though, through the.
Greatnefs of your F riend{hip towards
me, you endeavour .to hide my
Faults. a tle AN
. Nor need you mention the bodily
Exercifes of Fafting and Watching,
of lying upon the cold Ground, and

cannot be ignorant how very fhort I
fall of thefe things; which though
I performed never fo exactly, yet,
even then, they would not be of
Service to me, towards the happy
_Adminiftration of this high Office,
while this Indolence,, like a dead
Weight, lay upon me. Thefe bodily
Aufterities, it is true, may be of
no {mall Ufe to a Man, that is cloy-
{tered up in his Cell, and hath none

OR let ‘it be Matter of Won-

der to you, if, together with
this Firmnefs and Patience, I require
yet a farther Proof of For titude in a
Bifhop. For, truly, to contemn
good Fare, and eafy Lodging, is‘no
fuch dificult Tafk: We fee many.
do it, efpecially thofe of the ruftic

Sort, that are brought up, from their
Youth,
of the PRIESTHOOD, 145
Youth, to a hardy Way of Living;

and, befides this, how many more
are there, who, -either by their na-
tural Conftitution, or by long Ufe
and Cuftom, render thofe Severities’
eafy and familiar to them. But, to
bear Injury and Wrong, infolent
Words and biting Scoffs, thrown
out from our Inferiors, fometimes
lightly, and in Jeft, at other Times’
purpofely, and in Earneft; to be
loaded with groundlefs Complaints
and unjuft Accufations, as well by
thofe of the firft Rank, as by thofe
of the meaner and bafer Sort; to
bear thefe Tryals, I fay, with Tem-
per, is not in the Power of many ;
but it is an Excellence, which only
a very few can arrive at. Nay, one
may fee many Inflances of Perfons
who have Refolution enough to un-
dergo bodily Hardfhips, who, when

L they
146 ST. CHRYsosTOM

they come_to experience thefe latter
Sort of Tryals, can prefetve no to-
lerable Decency, but, as if their
Senfes were loft, they become fiercer’
and more furious than any wild
Beaft: And fuch as thefe ought by
no means to be admitted to the
epifcopal Office.

It is not neceflary for the Welfare
of the Church, that a Bifhop fhould
be eminent for his Abftinence, or
other bodily Mortifications; nor, if
he is not, will it be of any Diflervice
to it. But intemperate Paffion, and
extravagant Anger, in a Perfon of
that facred Character, are attended
with the worft Confequences, both
to himfelf, and to all about him. -
Befides, God hath threatened no
Punithment to thofe who negle&
the former; but to them that are
guilty of the latter, that is, to them
; avo
of the PRizsTHOOD. 147
who are angry without a Caufe*,
Hell, and the Flames of it, are me-
naced and denounced. As, there-
fore, the vain-glorious Man, by being
promoted to a Poft of Honour, hath
fo much the more Fuel added to his
Fire; juft fo it fares with a Man,
who (having no Power to bridle his
Paflion while he lived by himfelf,
and was converfant with very few),
. when he comes out into the World,
and hath the Management of a great
Multitude committed to him, like a
wild Beaft provoked and baited on
all Sides, grows outrageous; and io
becomes the Author of much Dif-
quiet to himfelf, and of many In-
conveniences to his People.

OR nothing fo clouds and di-

fturbs the Clearnefs and Per-
{fpicuity of the Mind, as inordinate
and exceffive Tranfports of Anger,
by which even wife Men have been
deftroyed: For, when that Paffion is
predominant, the Eye of the Under-
ftanding is like one fighting in the
Dark, not able to diftinguifh between.
Friends and Foes, between Men of
Quality and'the bafer Sort ; but ufes
all alike: And fo obftinately ‘is the
Man bent upon purfuing the Heat of
his Pafiion, that, though he furter
never fo much for it-himéfelf, he will
chearfully undergo it, rather than
not gratify his prefent evil Pleafure:
For, indeed, there is a certain Sort
of Pleafure in the Ragings of Anger,

which,

which, where it hath the Afcendant,
tyrannizes, and puts the whole Frame
of the Soul into the utmoft Diforder,
beyond the Power of any other Paf-
fion. For this often drives Men to
Acts of Arrogance and groundlefs
Hatreds; it is continually finding
out imaginary Affronts, and caufes
Men both to fpeak and to do many
things of an offenfive Nature. And
thus the Soul is hurried away by the
irrefiftible Force of this Paflion ; and
not having where to fix itfelf, knows
not how to withftand the Violence
and Impetuofity of it.
BASIL.

I can bear this Diffimulation of
yours no longer: For who is there
that knows not how far you are from
being attached to this Vice?

Lg Cury-
tso. «St, Curysostom

CHRYSOSTOM.

And why, then, my good Friend,
would you bring me near this Fire,
and roufe that wild Beaft, which,
at prefent, lies dormant within me?
or, can you be ignorant, that, if I
have hither to efcaped this Vice: it
oy not been through any natural

Excellence of my own, but becaufe
T courted a folitar ry Life?

For, indeed, it is well, if a Per-
fon, who is‘ef a warm Temper,
con avoid thofe Tumours of Soul;
though ‘he live, as it were, by him-
feil, and converfe only with two or
three particular Friends: But it will
be much more difficult to do it, if
once he falls into that Depth of
‘Cares and Diftractions which I men-
tioned juft now; and, when this
happens, he not only runs himfelf
upon the P Precipice of Deftrmion,

but
of the Prizstuoop. x51

but he involves many others in the
fame. Ruin, by exafperating their
Minds, and rendering them lefs in-
clined to the good-natured Offices of
Humanity and Moderation.

For’ it is natural for thofe of the
meaner Sort, to-obferve the Manners
and Behaviour of their Superiors, and
to imitate and copy after them, as
from an Original. How then fhall
he pretend to fupprefs thofe Swel-
lings and Inflammations in others,
who is fo liable to them himfelf?
or what Subjects will be difpofed to
practife Meeknefs and Moderation —
towards one another, when they {ee
their Prince given up to Anger and
Paffion? And, befides, there is no
Poflibility of concealing the Vices of
a Bifhop: The very Slips and Frail-
ties of a Perfon of fo confpicuous a

bL4 Cha-
152 St. CuRysosTom

CharaGer, will appear and be mani-
feft in full View. ;

The Weaknefs and. Unfkilfulnefs
of a Combatant may be undifco-
vered, while he flays at home, and
hath no Antagonift to engage with ;
but. when: he comes out into =m
Fiel ae it is impoflible to conceal his
Impotence: It will prefentl y appear
ibe heis. Thus the Retirement of
thoie that lead a private and inactive
Life is, as it were, a Veil to cover their
Defeéis ; but when once they come
forth into the World, and are forced
to throw afide that Veil, the in-
ward Paffions and- Difpofitions of
their Mind become, in a manner,
naked, and expofed to public View,
by Shea outward Actions and Dif-
orders. As, therefore, a right or-

dering of their Lives would_be of.

,
fingulas
of the PRIESTHOOD, 153

fingular Ufe to others, by ftirring
them up to imitate fo good an
Example; fo, on the other hand,
their Vices render thofe, who ob-
ferve them, fo much the more in-
difpofed to the Practice of Virtue,
and more fluggith and ‘unapt for the
Performance of things excellent and
praife-worthy.

The Soul of a Bifhdp, therefore,
ought, by all means, to fhine out
fo beautiful and illaftrious with the
‘Beams of Virtue and Goodnefls, as
at once to delight the Eye and affect
the Heart of the Spectators: For the
Vices of private Perfons, committed
fecretly, and (as it were) in the
Dark, bring Ruin only upon the
Aétors .themfelves ; whereas the
Vices of thofe, that are Men of
Eminence and high Station, bring
univerfal Detriment to all; making

thoie
154 St. CHRYSOSTOM

thofe that are negligent of a good
Life, much more fo; and provoking
thofe that have a Concern. for their
Souls, to {piritual Pride; and to-an
over-weaning Opinion of themfelves.
Moreover, the Mifcarriages of the
vulgar Sort, though they are public,
give no mortal Wound to Religion ;
but if they fin, who are exalted
to this high Station, not only
they themfelves are. con{picuous . to
all, but the Errors which they are
guilty of, wong {mall in Compa-
tifon, appear of a larger Size to the
Eye of the World: And the Reafon
of this is, becaufe the World com-
monly forms its Judgment, in Cafes
of this Nature, not from the Hei-
noufnefs of the Sin itfelf which is
committed, but from the Dignity of
the Perfon, who commits it.

A
of the PRIESTHOOD, 156

A Bifhop, therefore, ought to be
armed on. all Sides with Vigilance
and Sobriety, as. with a Coat of
Mail, and to look carefully about
him, left the: Enemy, {pying any
Advantage, any Place naked and un-
guarded, fhould fix there a deadly
Wound: For, indeed, a Perfon of
that facred Character is furrounded,
on all Sides, by thofe that are pre-
pared to wound and fupplant him ;
not only open and avowed Enemies,
but even by thofe who profefs a
Friend{hip for’him, _

For this Reafon, they that are
chofen to be Bifhops, ought to have
Souls as invulnerable, as, by the
Gift of God, the Bodies of thofe
Saints were, which were caft into the
burning fiery Furnace*: For the
Fuel of that Fire, which feeds upon

* Dan. i.

their
156 St. CHRYSOSTOM

their Souls, is not Wood, Pitch, and
Tow, or other fuch Combuttibles,
but fomething of a more pernicious
and deftructive Nature: Nor, in-
deed, is the Fire itfelf a material
and fenfible Fire, but that moft de-
vouring one of Envy, encircling the:
Soul, flaming forth on all Sides, and
penetrating more exquifitely into
their Lives, than the Babyloni/b Fire
did into the Bodies of thofe holy
Men; in which, if it find never fo
little Stubble: (never fo few Vices), it
immediately catches hold ‘of it, and
not only fets the vitiated and rotten
Part in a Flame, but leaves the reft
of the Building, though brighter than
the Sun before, all over darkened,
and fullied with Smoke. For, as
long as the Life and Actions of a
Bifhop are uniform, and of a-piece,
he is Proof againft all the Affaults
of
ofthe PRIESTHOOD. 157

of his Enemies; but, when once he
makes a. falfe Step (which muft
fometimes happen, as he is but a
Man, and confequently fubje& to
human Frailties), all his former Vir-
tues will not be able to fecure him
trom the evil Tongues of his Ac-
cufers; but this fingle Mifcarriage
will caft.a.Cloud over the reft of
his Excellences. Nor will the Ge-
nerality of Men judge favourably of
a Bithop, or confider him as a Man
cloathed with the fame Nature as
themfelves ; but cenfure him as if
he were an Angel, exalted above
human Infirmities. Thus the Sub-
jets of a Tyrant, as long as he is
eftablithed in his Power, fear and
fiatter him, becaufe they are not
able to dethrone him; but, when
once his Affairs are unprofperous,
they, who, juft before, were his

obfe-
x58 Sr. CHRYSOSTOM

‘obfequious Friends, laying afide alt
their pretended Refpe&, become
his utter Enemies, and, marking
his Weaknefs, depofe his Perfon,
and -diffolve his Government ; juft
thus it often fares with a Bifhop :
‘They, who but a little while ago,
when he was in full Power, paid
him all Reverence and Efteem, if
once they have the flighteft Occafion
againtt him, ufe all the Arts they
‘can to deprive him of his Office, by
‘depofing him, not as a Tyrant only,
but as fomething worfe: And as a
Tyrant hath the greateft Dread and
Apprehenfion of his own Guards;
fo a Bifhop fears thofe chiefly of the
facerdotal Order, which are neareft
to him: For thefe are moft apt to
covet his Dignity, and thefe are beft
acquainted with his Faults and Fail-
ings; for, being near his Perfon, if

any
of the PRIESTHOOD. 189
any fuch thing happens, they firft

of all perceive it; and fo it is in
their Power, with the greateft Eafe,
to -mifreprefent -him, and to be
credited; to undermine and fup-
plant him, whom they thus calum-
niate, by aggravating and magnify-
ing his Faults. And thus the Saying
of the Apoftle * is quite inverted ;
Lf one Member fuffer, the other Mem-
bers will rejoice ; and if one Member
be honoured, the other Members faf-
fer: Unlefs, indeed, by his fingular
Piety and Virtue, he is able to keep
his Ground, and ftand firm againft
all the Attacks of his Enemies.

And now, my Friend, give me
Leave to afk, Would you have been
willing to thruft me into fo dan-
gerous an Employment? or, can you
think my Soul endued with Forti-

71 Cor. xn. ao.

tude fufficient for Tryals of fo various
and different a Nature? If you
think it is, tell me who hath thus
informed you? If, indeed, God
hath, by any divine Revelation,
made it known to you, do but de-
monftrate the Truth of it, and I
will believe you; but if not, if in
this Matter you depend upon human
Opinion only, ceafe any longer to
be thus impofed upon: For, as to
my own Virtues and Abilities, I
myfelf am certainly the beft Judge,
and ought to be believed before
others: For what Man knoweth the
things of a Man, fave the Spirit of
a Man which is in him * 2

And, truly, by this Time, I think,
it muft fuficiently appear, how much
I fhould have expofed both myfelf
and my Electors, had I fubmitted to

the Choice,, and taken this facred
Office upon me, from which I
muit afterwards have retired with
Difcredit, and returned very dif-
advantageoufly to my private Sta-
tion. If this is not clear from what
I have faid already, yet it may be
farther proved from hence, that
not Envy only, but that which is
-worle than Envy, I mean an am-
bitious Defire of obtaining that
facred Dignity; oftentimes arms.a
great many Perfons again{ft him,
who is in Poffeffion of it: And, as
Children, that have a covetous Eye
upon their Father’s Eftate, think it
long till he dies, and leaves it to

nour a great while, becaufe it is not

a principal Circumftance, and what
ought to weigh very much in this
Cale), I fhould not dare, even upon
this Account, to chufe him imme-
diately, unlefs, befides the Clear-
nefs of his Life, he had alfo a large
Share of Prudence and Difcretion.
For, indeed, I myfelf have known
many who have been cloiftered in
a Monaftery, and there exercifed
themfelves with Mortifications, who,
as long as they lived thus retired,

him tot the epifcopal Throne; be-
caufe he might, - however advanced |
in Years, be altogether unfit for that
high Charge. Nor do I {peak this
out of any Difrefpect to grey Hairs,
or as if I would exclude all monafti-
cal Perfons from this {piritual Com-
mand (for I muft own that fuch Men
have been fometimes feen to make
a fhining Figure in the epifcopal
Chair), but I do it to fhow, that if
neither Piety, nor Length of Years,.
can of themfelves qualify Perfons for
the worthy difcharging the Office
of a Bithop, much lefs can any. of
thofe Reafons whigh, I mentioned

than this? that Men, full of all Per-

no Regard to the Virtues and Ex-
cellences of the Mind, but preferred

vanced in Years, or of noble Dig-
nity: But fince I have heard, that
this unreafonable Praétice is intro-
duced even into the Church, I ceafe
any longer to think fo feverely of —
the other.. For what Wonder is it,
if worldly Men, who defire to be
popular, and will do any thing for
Money, fall into thofe Errors, which
even they, that pretend to be free

from thefe Vices, are, upon the’
whole; “no lefs:fubjé@ to; and they
too, Men ‘that are. donbertiet for *

If-you enquire. into the Caufes of
this Evil, you will find them pretty
near of kin to thofe which I men-
tioned before, -and that Envy” is”
the Root and Parent - of them: ‘
The Pretences, however, are dif-”
ferent. One Man muft be rejected,
becaufe he is young; -another, be-
caufe he is too honeft to flatter ; a

- And now I would gladly atk,
What muft a Bifhop do, who hath

firm againft the Violence of fo many
Waves, or repell the Force of all
thefe Shocks? If, in the Manage-
ment of this Affair, he refolves to
act on juft and reafonable Grounds,
all thefe Men become at once Ene-
mies to him, and to thofe whom he
admits; doing every thing they can
to crofs and oppofe him; exciting
Cries and Tumults every Day againft
him, and cafting out a thoufand
Scoffs on thofe whom he chufes, till
they either get thefe ejected, or in-
troduce their own Candidates. So
that the Cafe of a Bithop, in this

thofe to: the-facred Order, whom he

will he have God for his Enemy,

be increafed, while, by-their mu-

. "To begin, then, with that which
- feems eafier and lighter than the reft,
I mean, the Management of ‘the
poor Widows: This appears, at firft
View, to bring little other Care
along with it,: than that of laying
out the Church’s Money; but, in
Truth, it is quite otherwife. For,
as often:as any are to be chofen into
that Society; much Diligence is ‘ne-
ceflary, to make Enquiry into the
Characters of them; the chufing of
fuch Perfons, without due Care,
having been the Caufe of infinite
Mitchiefs: For by fuch’ Perfons
Families have been corrupted, Mar-
riages diflolved, and they have often
given themfelves up to Stealing, and
other diforderly and fhameful Prac- —
tices. |
“Now; that fuch: as thefe fhould

Money, befides that it deferves to
be punifhed by God, and con~
demned by Man, tends alfo to dif-
courage and {top the Hands of well-
’ difpofed Perfons. For who would
be pleafed to fee thofe Benefactions,
which were defigned for the Ho-
nour of Chrift, confumed in main-
taining People, who are a conftant
Reproach and Difhonour to his holy
Name? There ought, therefore, to
‘be diligent Enquiry made, not only
to keep off all fuch as I have men-
tioned already, but others alfo, who,
being able to maintain themfelves,
ought not to devour the things
which were defigned for the Suf-
tenance of thofe who are not able.
Nor is this the only Inftance where
Circumfpection is requifite: After
the beft Search and Examination,
there is fill no lefs Care neceflary,

that the Fountain of Charity flow
freely to them, and that their Al-
lowances be not wanting, nor fall

and full of Murmur; and there is
Need of no {mall Share of Prudence
-and Diligence to ftop their Mouths,
‘and take away from them all Occa-
fion of Complaint.

». Now, there are many who think,
that if a Man be but generous, he is
forthwith qualified for this Province;
-but I cannot think that this Great-
nefs of Mind is of itfelf fufficient:
Though, I muft own, a Perfon in
that Office ought efpecially to be
endued with «this Excellence (for
without it he would be a Deftroyer,

- And, no doubt, it is a double
Misfortune to fuch unhappy Perfons,
firft, that they are conftrained to be
clamorous and prefling, through the
pinching Neceflity of Hunger; and
next, that being driven to thefe
Straits, they are reproached for
it: For while, to prevent ftarving,
they are forced to beg, and in beg-
ging are obliged to-put on a bold
Face,.-and, for fo doing, are con-
tumelioufiy ufed, how can it be,
-but that a various and difmal Scene
»of Sadnefs and Defpondency muft
overwhelm the Soul?

He, therefore, that hath the.Care
of the Poor, ought to have a good
Share of Patience .towards them ;
not only not to add Sorrow to Sor-
row, by any Peevifhnefs of his own ;
but alHfo, by his courteous Behaviour,
to faftep and alleviate thofe Troubles

when a feafonable Relief is attended

mean the Attendance on thofe that
are fick, is a Circumftance which
requires a good Share of Patiencé
and Application: For Perfons in
that Condition are commonly very
difficult, and hard to be pleafed ;

N*t T, as for what relates to
the Government of the Vir-
gins, the Fear and Concern for them

‘are as much greater than thofe for
the

the Widows, as the Gift which they
poffefs is more precious, and theif
State and Society more honourable :
And efpecially, becaufe it is not
long fince mary diforderly and vi-
cious Women were found to have
intermixed in the Company of thofe
confecrated Perfons; to the great
Grief of all good Men: And as it
is by no means the fame things.
whether it be a Woman of good
Birth who tranfgrefles, or her Maid- —
fervant; no lefs Difference is there
between the Faults of a Virgin and
a Widow: For; as for this latter
Sort, if they are given to idle Talk,
to reproachful Words, or to Flat-
tery ; ; if they are apse Gad- |
ders abroad; and fond of thowing
theméfelves at all publicyPlaces 3 it'is
not to be wondered at; nor is it greatly
regarded : But the holy Virgin, who
8 : hath
of the PrizstuooD. 19%
hath raifed her Thoughts to things
of a higher and more excellent Na-=
ture; fhe that follows earneftly after
that Wifdom which is from above ;
fhe that hath engaged herfelf to lead
the Life of Angels here on Earth,
and, in the midft of Flefh and
Blood, to imitate the Sandtity of
thofe incorporeal Beings, fhe, I fay,
ought by no means to indulge her-
felf in any of thefe things. Parti-
eularly, fhe fhould avoid all fre-
quent and unneceflary rambling
abroad, ail vain and foolifh Dif- |
courfe, and the very Names of Flat-
tery or Reviling fhould not be fo
much as known to her. And, for
this Caufe, there fhould be the
{trier Watch, and a greater Guard,
kept over fuch Perfons. For that
wicked Spirit, who is a profeficd
Enemy to their Holinefs, is always

at
tg3 Sr. CurysosTomM

at hand, laying Snares for them;
into which if any of them fall, he
is forthwith ready to devour them:
Men alfo are, on all Sides;. watching
to betray their Innocence; and;
what is yet more, they have the
Exorbitances of their own corrupt
Nature to deal with: -So’that the
holy Virgin hath a double Enemy to
arin herfelf againft, him who attacks.
her from without, and him who
tempts her from within.

He, therefore; that hath the
Care of thefe Virgins, cannot but
be in conftant Fear, Danger, and
Trouble, left, by fome Misfortune |
(which God forbid); any of his —
Pupils fhould mifcarry. For, if zhe

he be concerned, who, though he
hath none of thefe things to fear,
hath, neverthelefs, others of a much
more weighty and important Na-
ture? For, in this Cafe, not the
Contempt of the Hufband is to be
dreaded, but the Contempt of Chrift
himfelf; nor doth Unfruitfulnefs
here terminate in Reproaches,, but
in the Ruin and Deftru€tion of the
Soul. For thus our Saviour de-
clares +, Every Tree which bringeth

in open Court: Moreover, fhe is
free from the Care of providing for
a Family, and from the Attacks of
injurious Perfons ; fo that nothing
of this Kind lays any Conftraint upon
her of appearing in public. In all
Cafes, her Father is her Guard and
Prote&tor ; and fhe hath only this
one Care incumbent on her, not to
fay or do any thing unworthy of
or unbecoming the Character of a
Virgin.

But now, in the Cafe of the holy
Virgins, and their {piritual Father,
there are many things which render
it very difficult, if not impoflible,
for him to keep a ftri&t Watch over
them. For he cannot have them at
home with him, under his own Eye;
fuch.a Cohabitation would neither

be decent nor fafe: And, though
O 2 there
196 StT.Curysostom

there were no rcal Hurt in it, but
they did, on both Sides, preferve
their Sanctity untouched, yet would
they be accountable for the Scandal
they gave, no lefs than if they had
been actually faulty towards one an-
other. Such a Cohabitation, there-
fore, being impracticable, it muft
of Confequence be fo. much the
harder for a Bifhop, to find out and
obferve the feveral Inclinations and
Difpofitions of thofe Virgins, to
correct the Diforders of fome, to
exercife and improve the Virtues of
others, and to difcover the Haunts
of thofe that are addicted to ramble
abroad. There is efpecially one
Circumftance which hinders a Bi-
fhop from examining nicely into
the Behaviour of fuch Perfons; and
that is, where the Virgin is poor,

and at her own Dilpofal. For there
fhe
of the PRiEsTHOOD, 197
fhe is under a Neceflity of providing
for herfelf; from whence arife many
Occafions and Pretences, if fhe is fo
difpofed, of rambling abroad: And
he that will oblige fuch a one to live
always retired, muft firft remove all
thofe Pretences, by ‘furnifhing her
with a Competency of all Necef-
faries, and a Servant ta attend her
on all Occafions: Farther, fhe mutt
be reftrained from Funerals and
Night-watchings; for, at fuch holy
Solemnities, the Enemy is at hand,
and that fubtle Serpent knows how
to take Occafion, even from the
Exercife of good Duties, to infinuate
his Poifon. A Virgin, therefore,
fhould be, as it were, immured and
environed on all Sides, and very
rarely go from home, and then only
on the moft urgent: and indifpenfible
Occafions.

If any one object here, What hath
a Bifhop to do with thefe things?

he who is not able to procure this
for them, though he have ever fo.
many Reafons to urge in his own
Behaif, will be fure not to efcape
the Severity of their Lafh.

And here, fince I have mentioned
this Subjeé&t of Patronage, I will
proceed to fhow you another
thing, which often becomes the Oc-
cafion of much Blame, and many.
Complaints, to a Bifhop.: For, un-
lefs he is every Day more conftant
in viliting his People, than thofe

about, even from hence will arife
unfpeakable Offence: For not the
Sick only expec to be attended by:
him, but thofe alfo that are well;
and this not eut of any religious
Principle, but merely for State, and
to have Refpe&t fhown them. And
if, at any Time, it happens that,
for the common Good: and Intereft
of the Church,. he is more frequent
than ufual in his Vifits to fome one
of the wealthier and greater Sort,

prefently he is seats, of Flattery
and artful Addrefs.

But why do I fpeak of thefe Cafes
of Patronage: and Viliting ? fince,
even from bare Salutations and com-
mon Civilities, fuch Imputations are
thrown on a Bithop, as are enough

to overwhelm his Mind, and fink

him with Defpondency. Nay, even
his
of the PRIESTHOOD. 20,

his very Looks will be cenfured,
and his moft inoffenfive Adions,
which are done innocently, and
without Defign, are nicely fcanned
and examined into:. His Voice, and
the Manner of his Speech; his Look,
and the Air of his Countenance ;
nay, his very Smiles, and the De-
grees of his Mirth. . How profu/ely,
they cry, he laughed with fuch a
one! how kindly he looked upon bint
and [poke to him with all the Frank-
nels ienaginable; but me he fichted
and neglected, And fo, ina Room
full of Company, unlefs he be par-
ticularly careful to obferve every
finele Perfon, and falute him di-
finaly, it is by many refented, and
deemed an Affront..

And who but a Man of a very
fleady and undaunted Spirit is fufh-

cient to maintain his Ground againft

fo
204 ST. CHRYsosTom

fo many Obfervers, and not to be.
at all accufed by them, or being
accufed, to ftand clear of the Ac-
cufation? A Bifhop, indeed, ought
to have no Accufers; but, if that is
not poflible, the next thing defire-
able is to be able to wipe off thofe
Calumnies which are caft upon him:
But, if it be a difficult thing to do
this alfo, fince fome Men take a
fingular Pleafure in raifing vile Re-
prefentations out. of nothing, the
only thing that remains to be
done in fuch a Cafe, is to bear
up manfully, and with a good
Courage, as it were in Contempt
and Defiance of fuch Accufations,
For, truly, he that knows himfelf
to be juftly accufed of any Crime,
may, for that very Caufe, the more
eafily bear with his Accufer: For,
having at the fame Time a more

fevere

fevere Accufer within himflf, I
mean, his own Confcience; and
being firft of all taxed and con- |
demned by that inward and mof
troublefome Witnefs, he the more
patiently endures the Blame ‘of thofe
without, as the gentler and much
more tolerable of the two.

But when an innocent Perfon is
wrongfully accufed, he is fo much
the fooner tranfported with Anger,
and is fo much the more apt to fall
into Defpondency, unlefs he have
Hrft of all armed himfelf againft
thefe things, and is prepared to bear
with Patience the Folly of others :’
For, indeed, it is hardly poflible,

the fpiritual Surgeon, who’ manages
the Soul in this Manner, muft cer-
tainly partake of the Wrath due to
thofe Sins, which break out upon
the Soul of the Sinner, after fuch an

And how fore muft his Punith-
ment be, who muft be anfwerable
not only for the Sins which he is
guilty of himfelf, but for thofe alfo
which others commit? For, if we
juftly dread to give an Account for

doing, to efcape the Pains of Hell,

If, indeed, you had ambitioufly
affected this facred Dignity, there had
been fome Foundation for this Fear:
For he that, by aiming at it, con-
fefles himfelf capable of fo weighty
an Adminiftration, if he prove
deficient therein, after it is com-
mitted to his Charge, hath no room
to plead Inexperience in his Excufe.

By his afluming the Office, he
cuts himfelf off fram this Pretence :
Nor

Nor can he, who comes to it vo-
luntarily, and with an afpiring
Mind, fay in his own Behalf, “ Ihave
‘¢ finned in this Matter much againft
“ my Will: I have loft fuch a Soul
‘¢ altogether ayainft my own Incli-
‘‘ nations.” For, in this Cafe, he
that fhall one Day judge fuch a one,

your own Inexperience, and that
“ you had not fufficient Abilities
“¢ for the unblameable Adminiftra-
‘“‘ tion of this Function, did you
“ thus prefume to undertake what
was fo far above your Power?
«© Who obliged you to it? Did you
«© fhun, and fly from it, and was you
‘© drawn back again by Force?” But
nothing of this Nature can be ob-
jected to you; you will have nothing

P 2 of

212 Str. Curysostom

of this Kind to condemn yourfelf
for; fince it is notorious to all, that.
you have, in no Degree, follicited
this Honour, but it was offered you
by the Judgment and Determination
of others. So that every thing which
excludes thofe prefumptuous Af
fumers of that high Office from all
Excufe and Pardon, might have
ferved to furnifh you ep
with both.

I fmiled a little at this, and,
fhaking my Head at the plain Sim-
plicity of the Man, replied thus.

CHRYSOSTOM.

I could with, indeed, that it were
as you fay, O thou beft of Men!
though not on my own Account, or
that I might have an Opportunity
_of accepting that Office which I fo
lately fed from: For, if it were fo,
that I was to expe& no Punifhment,

th ouch
of the PRIESTHOOD. 212

though I was carelefs and unfkilful
in my Management of Chrift’s Flock,
yet it would be worfe to me than all
Punifhment, to confider how far
my Adminiftration of that excellent
Office fell fhort, and, indeed, was
utterly unworthy of the Dignity of
him who committed it to my Care.
For what Reafon, then,” do you
think that I could with you was not
miftaken in your Opinion of this
Matter? Truly for the Sake of thofe
miferable and unhappy Perfons (for
fuch I muft call them), who have
no Skill or Underftanding for the ~
due Difcharge of this high Office
(though you pretend never fo often
that they were forced to it, and
_ therefore, that their Errors herein
are Sins of Ignorance), I fay, I could
with it for their Sakes, that. fo they
might, by this means, efcape that

P 2 un-
214 St. Curysostom

unquenchable Fire, that utter Dark-
nefs, the never-dying Worm, the
being cut in funder, and the having
their Portion with Hypocrites and
Unbelievers.

But what fhall I fay? It is not
fo; it is by no means fo. And of
this, if you pleafe, I will give you
a plain Proof, from the Cafe of a
Kingdom, for which, however, God
never exprefied that Regard, which
he hath for the Priefthood.

Saul, for Inftance, that Son of
Kifb*, was not ftudioufly ambitious
of being a King. He was in Pur-
fuit of his loft Affes; and for thofe
only it was, that- he came to en-
quire; though Samuel, indeed, gave
him Tidings of the Kingdom. But.
neither even then did he haften ta
ebrain that high Dignity, though
7% 1 San, my, |

of the PRIESTHOOD, 215

promifed it by the Mouth of a Pro-
phet ; butshe fhunned and declined
it, faying,, Who am L? and what is
my Father's Floufe? |
But now, give me Leave to afk :
When Saz/ afterwards abufed that
Power, with which he was invefted
by God, are thofe Words of his fuf-
ficient to fkreen him from the Wrath
of God, by whom he had been fo
highly exalted? Or, when Samuel.
reproved him for his Male-admini-
ftration, had he any Room, by way
of Excufe, thus to reply to him:
_ & What would you have? Did I
“ affe@ the Kingdom? Was 1
‘“‘ eagerly defirous of the regal.
‘¢ Power? No: It was my Defire
‘“< to have kept myfelf in a private
‘¢ Station. JI had led. a quiet and
‘< inactive Life, had you not dragged
“© me out to this Dignity: In which
P 4 ‘¢ humble.
e216 Sr. CHRYSOSTOM

‘¢ humble State had I continued,
I fhould eafily have avoided all —
“* thefe Mifdemeanors. Had I ftill
“¢ been one of the obfcure Multi-
« tude, I had not been fent on this
«© Expedition; nor had God com-
“¢ mitted to my Management the
“« War againft the Amalekites; which
‘¢ had I not engaged in, I had never
“© committed fuch an Offence?”
But all thefe Pleas would have

been infufficient for his Excufe:
Nay, not only infufficient, but dan-
gerous; inafmuch as they would
have tended the more to excite
God’s Wrath againift him. For, in-
deed, he that is advanced to any
Office beyond his Merit, .inftead of
making the Greatnefs of his Dignity
an Excufe for his Errors therein,
ought to make Ged’s efpécial Fa-
your towards him an Occafion of
: greater

¢

greater, Improvement in Virtue:

Whereas he that, from the Excel:

lence of his Dignity, thirfks himfelf
fo much the more at Liberty to fin,
what does he thereby, but charge
the Divine Benevolence as the Caufe
of his Wickednefs? A Practice very
common with thofe who give them-
{elves up to an ungodly and fenfual
Life. But we, for our Part, ought
by no means to be thus difpofed,

nor to fall into the fame Madnefs
with fuch Perfons, but endeavour,

at all Times, to have a due Govern-
ment over thofe things, which pro-
ceed from ourfelves, that we neither

fpeak nor think difhonourably of
Ged. nits

For (to leave the Cafe of a King-
dom, and proceed to that of the
Priefthood, which is the more imme-

diate Subject of our prefent Difcourfe)
neither
218 Sr. CHoRYSOSTOM

neither did £4 afpire to that high
Office. Yet what Advantage was
it to him? when he finned, in the
ill Execution thereof? But why do
I fay afpire? when, it is plain, he
could not have avoided it, if he
would: He was under a legal Ne-
ceflity to accept it. For he was of
the Tribe of Lev, and was, for
that Reafon, obliged to undertake
that high Office, which defcended
to him from his Anceftors. And,
neverthelefs, we find how feverely
he was punifhed for the infolent
Diforders of his Sons. Nay, even
Aaron himfelf, the firft High-Prieft
of the Yews, concerning whom God
{poke fo many things to Mo/es; be-
caufe, in the Bufinefs of the golden
Cali, he alone could not withftand

Brother interpofed in his Behalf.

» And here, fince we have men-
tioned Mo/fes, it will not be impro-
per to confirm the Truth of ‘my
Pofition, even from what happened
to this ereat Man. For this excel-
lent Perfon was fo far from afpiring
to the Government of the Fews, that,
when it was offered him, though
God commanded him to accept of
it +, he refufed; infomuch, that
God was angry with him. And
afterwards, when he had undertaken
it, he would gladly have died, to
have been difcharged from it: Jf
thou deal thus with me (faith he),
kill me, I pray thee, out of hand.

grefied afterwards, at the Waters of

Strife,
220 6ST. CuRYSOSTOM

Strife *, were thefe his repeated De-
nials fufficient to apologize for him,
or prevail ‘with God to pardon his
Offence? If fo, why did he fall
fhert of the promifed Land? Ger-
tainly for no other Reafon but this:
‘This was the Caufe why that ad-
mirable Man mified of that Happi-
nefs which others enjoyed; and, after
having endured fo many Fatigues
and Afflictions; after that unfpeak-
able Wandering in the Wildernefs ;
after fo many Battles fought, and

who fall fo infinitely fhort of the

admitted to apologize for our Errors,
by the Plea of not having afpired to

becaufe many of the Ordinations
now-a-days do not proceed from the
Difpofition of the Divine Grace, but
from the mere Defignation of Men.
Judas was chofen by God him-

he did to the reft, the Dignity of
the apoftolic Office. Nay, he en-
trufted him with fomething more:
He was our Saviour’s Aimoncr, and
had the Difpofal cf his Money *.

Money, which he fhould have laid
out well, did he, therefore, efcapeé
with Impunity?. No; fo far from
this, that he thereby wrought for
himfelf a much forer and more
grievous Punifhment; and that too
very defervedly. For, furely, it
would very ill become us to make
thofe Honours and Preferments, to
which God exalts us, Occafions of
abufing and offending him: They
fhould rather be fo many Obliga-
tions upon us, to endeavour the
more to pleafe him. . And he who
thinks, he fhall. efeape unpunifhed

plying, “ Why then did you come,

“ much the greater?”

The Man who fhould argue thus,
might juftly be deemed = For
certainly a Phyfician attends, not to
give the Patient over, but to recover
him; not to neglect his Cafe, but
completely to cure him, But then,
if you that are fick wilfully with-
draw yourfelf from the Hands of

heavier Condemnation: For as you

fee your Phyfician before your Eyes,
you fhun and avoid him, it will not
be poflible for you to get rid of
them. And thus not being able to
be delivered from your Sins (for
they are the Maladies here meant),
you are fure to fuffer Punith-
ment, not for them only, but alfo
becaufe you rendeted vain, as far
as you were able, his good En-
deavours for you. From whence it
follows, that Men are to expect

Will a Man undertake to build, who
is no Archite@t? or will any one
attempt the Cure of fick Perfons,
who hath no manner of Skill or
Knowledge in Phyfic? or, though
fuch a one fhould be much impor- _
tuned, would he not pofitively per-
fift in his Refufal, and not be
afhamed to own his Ignorance ?
And fhall not 4e much rather dili-
gently confider and examine him-
felf, to whom the Care of fo many
Souls is to be entrufted? or, fhall
he prefume, though ignorant and
unfkilful, to execute Tene facted
Function, becaufe one Man, per-

and difoblige a third? But is not
this the ready Way to caft both him-
felf and them too headlong into De-
ftru@ion? He might poflibly have
faved himfelf, had he continued as he
was (that is, in his’ private Station) ;
but now he draws others along with
him into Ruin: For from whence
is there Room to hope for Safety,
or to expect Pardon? In fuch a
Cafe as this, who will deprecate our
Punifhment, or intreat for us? Will
they that importuned and even
forced us to accept of this holy
Office? But who then will fave
them at that Time? For they them-

The Bifhop, therefore, who is

though they that chufe fuch a one

to efcape himfelf, but, in Truth,
fhall be mere etievoufly punifhed

chofe him purely for fome worldly
End, contrary to the Senfe and Dic-
tates of their own Confcience,. For,
if they fhall be’ found to have acted
thus; if, knowing a Man ta bé un-

their Punifhment fhall be equal,
nay, perhaps, fuperior to theirs, who

it into the Power of any Man to
corrupt the Church,’ who, before,
had it in ‘his Will to do it, is’ cer-
tainly arifwerable’ for the Outrages
which he commits. But if, in all

Chrift : For, according to St. Paul*,
the Church of Chrift is his Body; and

mitted, ought to ufe his utmoft En-

For what is this, but, according to
the beft of his Power, to render that
Body worthy of that blefled and in-
corruptible Head, which prefides
over it. For, truly, if, in refpe&
of our natural Body, they that de~

the Care of Chrift’s Body, by which
they are to engage ina Wariare, not
with Bodies like ours, but with in-
vifible Powers, be able to preferve
it found and whole, unlefs, being
aided by a fupernatural Skill, they
underftand all the Arts of Healing
proper for the Soul? |

CHAP. II.

Pa all this I need not add
what, no doubt, you well
know that that Body which I am
now fpeaking of, is liable to a
greater Variety of Difeafes, and
much more dangerous Afiaults, than
our own natural Flefh; and that as

the Members thereof are more eafily
corrupted, fo they are much harder

R to
-g42 Sr. Curysostrom

to be recovered. For they that have
the Cure of thefe our natural Bodies,
have many. Advantages, great Di-
verfity of Medicines, no lefs a Variety
of Inftruments, and a Diet, proper
and fuitable for the Patient; even
the fole. Temperament of the Air
is fometimes fufficient to reftore
Health; nay, a feafonable Slumber
hath, at other Times, had the fame
happy Effect, and faved the Phy-
fician all farther Labour.

But, in the fpiritual Cure of the
Body of Chrift, none of thefe Ad.
vantages are to be met with. There
is but enc Method, there is but one
Way, of recovering us after our evil
Deeds; and that is, by the Dedtrine
of the Divine Word. ‘That is the
Infirument; that, the Diet; that, the
beft Lcmperament of Aix; that {up-
phes the Place of Phyfic. If there be

Need

_
of tbe Prizstioop. 243
Need of fearing, that is the beft Cau-
{tic: That is the beft Incifion-knife,
if. there be Need of Amputation,
This is what we muft make uf of
in all thefe Cafes; arid if this doth
not effectually work a Cure, nothing
will. For, by this; the Soul is raifed
up from a drooping and languifhing
' State; by this, when it is blown up
with Vanity; thofe Swellings and
Tumors are reprefied; by this, we
cut off from it all Superfluities, and
fupply all Defects: And, ina Word,
this is the Inftrument by which we
perform all other Operations which
are requifite for the Welfare and
Health of the Soul.

It is true; indeed, in refpect of
our Morals, that the good Life of
another Perfon may provoke us to
Emulation; and it is pofiible for us
to arrive at 2 moft excellent Way of

R 2 Living,

=
e44 St. CHRYSOSTOM
Living, by the Influence of our
Neighbour’s Example. But when
the Sou] is infected with {purious
and heretical Opinions, there is then
ereat Neceflity for the Application
of this Divine Word of Doétrine;
and that, to keep our own People
clear of that Infection, as well as to
oppofe and encounter the Enemy.
Nay, if a Man were armed with zhe
Sword of the Spirit, and with the
Shield of Faith *, fo as to be able to
work Miracles, and, by thofe Mi-
racles, to {top the Mcuths of fhame-
Iefs and impudent Gainfayers, fuch
a Perfon ‘(one would think) fhould

of the Word: And yet, even here,

fore, who is to receive al! thefe dif-
ferent Attacks, to underfiand all
their Arts of War. He muft, at
once,. be fkilful at the Bow, and at

the Part of a fuperior and inferior
Officer ; of acommon Centinel, or a

one maintains that fingle Poft which
is affigned him, it is fufficient to
repell the Enemy: But he that de-
fires*to come off a Conqueror in this

ever*he fpies any one Place un-

throw in his Forces to deftroy the

248 Gay CHRYSOSTOM

Flock of Chrift: But this he cannot
do, where he perceives the Shepherd
coming againft him, well infiructed °
and fully apprifed of all his Snares
and Deceits. For this Caufe, we
ought to be well guarded in all
Parts: For our Cafe is not unlike
that of a City, which, as long as it
18 Ehaaharoeleiea on. all Sides “by a
ftrong Wall, continues fafe, and
laughs at her Befiegers; but if
once a fmall Breach - riot in it,
though but of the Bignefs of a Gate,
the Remainder of the Wall, let it
ftand never fo firm, will be of little
Ufe or Service to it, Juft thus its
fares with the City of God; fo. Jong
as the Wifdom and Vigilance of the.
Paftoy encompaffes her on all Sides, ©
as with a Wall, all hoftile Attempts
of an Enemy will end in his. own
Shame and Difgrace, while the In-

habitants

habitants remain fafe and unmolefted
within; but if once any fingle Part
of it be demolifhed, though the reft
ftand never fo faft, yet, through that
Breach, Ruin and Devaftation will
enter upon the Whole.

Thus, to what Purpofe doth a
Man argue fuccefsfully againft the
Gentiles, if, at the fame Time, he
becomes a Prey to the Jews? or,
what Advantage is it for him to be
a powerful Difputer againft them
both, if the Manichees are too power-
ful for him? or, fuppofing him too
hard for them alfo, what fhall he be
the better for it, if the Fatalifts and
Deftinarians break in upon him, and
‘make Ravage and Havock of the
Flock? But, not to enumerate all
the feveral Herefies which the Devil
hath introduced, it will be fufficient
to fay, that, unlefs a Paftor is fin-

oularly well fkilled in refuting them
_all, any one -of them will fer open a
Door for the Wolf to’enter, and de-

vour many of the Sheep of Chrift.
Befides, we may obferve, that, in
martial Engagements, the Victory is
commonly obtained, and the Defeat
given, by thofe Soldiers that ftand
their Ground, and fight bravely ly.
But in thefe fpiritual: Combats, it 18
quite otherwife: For, here, it often-
times falls out, that while fome are
contending, Uihenke that fit full, and
take no Pairis, enjoy the Victory.
This is the Cafe of any raw and un-
experienced’ Difputant, who, ‘like a
Soldier that hath his own Weapons
turned upon him,“ becomes ridiz
culous both to Friends. and: Foes.
Shall I make this plain to. you, by
an Example? The Inftance, then,
that I will give you is ‘this: -They
; who
of the PRIESTHOOD, 255
who receive the wild Do@trines of
Falentinus and Marcion; reje& out
of the Catalogue of the Divine Writ-
ings, the Law which: was given by
God to Mo/es.. On the other hand,
the Yews fo highly honour it, that
they contend for the Obfervance of
all ther ein commanded, though the
Time for thofe things being now ex~
pired, fuch an Obfervatices would be
contrary to the Will of God. But
now the Church, avoiding both thefe
Extremes, takes the middle Way ;
teaching, that though we are not
any longer to fubmit our Necks to
that Yoke, yet that the Law itfelf
ought not to be evil-fpoken of; and
though the Obligation thereto is
now at an End, yet we praife it for
its Ufefulnefs formerly, while it re-
mained in force. He, therefore,
that is to engage with thefe two
F Enemies,
252 St. CHRYSOSTOM

Enemies, ought, by all means, to
underftand this Medium: For if,
being defirous to fhow the Fews how
unfeafonably they are now attached
to the old Law, we fall upon it un-
mercifully, and declaim againft it
immoderately, we fhould give no
little Handle of Obloquy to thofe
Heretics to rail againft it. On the
other Side, if, to flop their Mouths,
we extoll it beyond Meafure, and
tun into large Encomiums upon it,
as a thing neceflary even now, then
we give as great a Handle to the
Jews, as we had before given to the
Heretics.

| Again, they Sac embrace the
mad Notions of Saéellius, or Arius,
do both of thera fall from the Sound-
nefs of the Faith, for want of ob-
ferving a due Mean. Both thofe
Heretics, indeed, are called .Céhri-

fiians 3
ofthe PRIESTHOOD. ‘253
fiians ; but, if you enguire into
their Doétrines, you will find the
one not much better. than the Jews,
and little differing from them, ex- —
cept in Name; and the others
very much refembling the-Herefy
of Paul of Samofata, and~both of -
them exceedingly deviating from
the Truth: re

Great, therefore, is- the Danger
in this Refpe@. The Truth hes in
a {trait and narrow Way, between
two fteep Precipices ;°and-there is
Reafon to fear, left, whilft we fight
fuccefsfully againft the one Sort of
Heretics, we ourfelves be wounded by
the other. For if we affert the Unity
of the Godhead, immediately Sade/-
ius draws that Expreffion to his own
impious Senfe. On the other hand,
if we make a Diftinétion, and fay,
that the Father is one, the Son an-

other,
2c4 St. CHRYSOSTOM

other, and the Holy Ghoft another,
Arius is ready to wreft that Diftinc-
tion of Perfons into a Difference of
Subftance. And it equally concerns
us to avoid the impious Confufion
of the one, and the mad Diverfity
of the other, by confefling the God-
head of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghoft, to be all one, and by adding
thereunto a Trinity of Perfons: For
thus fhall we fortily ourfelves againtt
both their Affaults.

Befides thefe, I might here reckon
up to you feveral other Adverfaries,
againit which except we fkirmifh
with Courage and Diligence, we
{hall be obliged to leave the Field
with Wounds and Difgrace.

it is neither poflible for them to

Numbers are bufy in fearching cu-
rioufly into thofe things which they
will never be able to find out; the
very Search after which ferves only
to provoke God’s Indignation. And
no Wonder: For if we endeavour to
pry into the Knowledge of thofe
things which God would hide
from our Eyes, we fhall not only
labour in vain (as, indeed, how
fhould it be otherwife, when we run

our very Search will be of dangerous

to lay the Blame’ not on his Infuf-

~ felves, as though they were weak,
and not able to. bear the Feft. And
thus, through the Unfkilfulnefs of

Men. Would you know what this
is? In fhort, it is Preaching; it is
that great Labour which is employed
in public Sermons.

For, in the farft Place, the
greater Part of Auditors will not
difpofe themfelves to hearken to the
Preachers.as to Perfons from whom
they fhould learn; but, difdaining
the Rank of Difciples, they take
upon them to aé the Part of thofe
rather that are Spectators at the
public Games; and as there the
Multitude is feparated into Parties,
and fome join themfelves to one,
and fome to another; fo here alfo
they are divided, fome run after one
Preacher, and fome after another,
according as they are carried away
by Favour or Dilfattection,

Nor is this the only Misfortune:
There is another attends this Matter,
not at all inferior to it. For if a
Preacher makes ufe of any Part of
another Man’s Works in his Sermon,
the borrowing of fo many Words
will be deemed a greater Difgrace
to him, than if he had ftolen fo much
Money; nay, fometimes the bare
Sufpicion of fuch a thing will do it,
though the Man be innocent.

But why do I mention the Op-
probrium of other Mens Works, »
when a Preacher is not allowed,
without great Variety, to ufe his
own? For many People hear Ser-
mons now-a-days, juft as they go
to Plays and Concerts, not for Edi-
fication, but Diverfion; and that
Eloquence which I fo declaimed

miences to himfelf and his Hearers;
_becaufe, on this Account, he en-
deavours to form his Difcourfes more.
to obtain their Favour and Praife,
than to do them Good.

And thus, as he who neither de-
fires the Praife of his Hearers, nor

can neither pleafe their Ears, nor

the greater Part of the Afiembly are

thofe that are able to judge of Ser-

Mr, Hoiuier.

Phat the primitive Church, from the
very Jfecond Century, made Prayers for the
Dead, we do not deny; but that thefe
Prayers were, to deliver them, out of Pur-
gatory, we fappofe. will not be avowed; it
being certain, that they were made for the
bef Men, for the holy Apoj/les, the Mar-
éyrs, and Confeffors of the Church, nay,
for the Bleffed Virgin herfelf; all which, at
the fame Time, they thought in Happinefs,
and who, the Papi fis themfelves tell us,
never touched at Purgatory. If any one

will put up his particular Requefts for the

had the whole World :committed:to
his Charge, and was. a common
Father of all, he draws near to
God, with humble Supplications,
that all Wars may every-where be
extinguifhed, and all Tumults be
iqueliedl that God would fend Peace
and Plenty; and that he would grant
to all Men a f{peedy Deliverance from
all impending Evils,-both public'and_

primitive Chriftians did, we fhall not con-
demn him.’ Only let not That be made an
Article of our. Faith, which we can never

this high Office; ought, in all things,
torexcell thofe for whom he inter-

But when he invokes the Holy
Ghoft, ‘and is performing the moft
tremendous Sacrifice, and makes his

-fhall we affign him! How great
Purity and Holinefs is requifite for

what Hands\thofe ought to be which

heavenly Powers, in Honour of him,
who lieth there, as we may réafon-
ably believe, from the Nature of the
Myfteries then celebrated.
I remember I was once told by
one, who had it himfelf from a
venerable old Man, who was ac~
cuftomed to fee Revelations, that
he had fuch a Vifion as this, at the
Time of this holy Celebration, and
faw before his Eyes, as well as mor-
tal Eyes could bear it, a fudden Ap-
pearance of a Multitude of Angels,
cloathed in white. Robes, encom-
pafiing the Altar, and bowing dewn
their Heads, as Soldiers doing
Homage to their Prince. And I
believe it. -Another like Inflance I
had from one, who was himfelf an
Eye and Ear-witnefs, who told me,
that when he miniftred to dying
Men,

Men, if they had been Partakers of
this Sacrament with a pure Con-
{cience, the Angels attended, at the
Moment of their Departure, and,
for the Sake of the holy Myftcries
which they had received, guarded
and conduéted them fafely out of
this Life.

And would you not tremble,
then, to engage me in fo facred a

is the thing chiefly required: Nor
is a good Habit of Body neceflary

fo very few, who. have been ad«

make any Figure in the Church,

the greater Part of them fall. into

Not fo ‘faft, my good Friend ;
Men of fuch Characters ought not
fo much as to be thought of, when
Perfons are ele&ted to the facred
Office of Bifhops. But if any one
is found that can be converfant in

and that toa Degree fuperior to them,
fuch a one is, by all means, to be
chofen, and that too, before them.
For fhould one of that Order, by
means of his Solitude, conceal the
Vices to which he is addicted, in
fuch a Manner, that they fhall not
appear; yet, whenever he comes
abroad into the World, thofe Vices
will difcover therfelves; and all
he will get by his Promotion will
be, that he will become more ri-
diculous, and be expofed to the
greater Danger; into which I myfelf
was very near falling, if the good
Providence of God had not pre-
vented it,

And, indeed, it is impoffible fuch
Indifpofitions of Soul fhould be con- -
cealed, when the Man is expofed to

of all. For as Fire difcovers the
Drofs in Metals, fo this Teft of the
Priefthood lays open the Souls of
Men: If a Man be wrathful, mean-
{pirited, ambitious, arrogant, or fub-
ject to any other Diftemper of Mind,
it-diicovers thofe Diftempers ; ad
not only difcovers them, but often
renders them more ftubborn and ob-
. ftinate than they were before. For
as bodily Wounds, when fretted, are |
thereby rendered much more diffi--
cult to be healed; {0 the Difeafes of ©
the Soul, being firred and exafpe-
rated, become naturally more fierce,
and precipitate thofe that are acted
by them into farther Sins. Thus
